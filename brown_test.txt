`` where'd you expect , the john ? ? END
`` where is that '' ? ? END
`` facing us , two flights up . END
look , old man , you can't go up . END
they won't even let you in the front door . END
so why don't you be a good boy and '' -- END
hoag grabbed him by the shoulders . END
`` listen to me , UNK . END
if you want to spend another day in the state department -- another day -- you get in there and tell that captain what i told you '' . END
he bit out the words . END
`` and you know i can do it '' . END
griffith raised UNK hands . END
`` easy does it , phil . END
i was just going . END
i'm on my way '' . END
he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back . END
on the second landing he paused to look for docherty , didn't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne . END
he took several large UNK , UNK that docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him . END
the way hoag was , no telling what he might say or do . END
he finished his champagne and climbed UNK to the next landing . END
at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress . END
`` yes , what is it '' ? ? END
`` i want captain docherty '' . END
he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him . END
docherty said , `` it's okay , UNK , let him by '' . END
they walked toward each other . END
`` well '' ? ? END
griffith said , `` hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ; END
it was UNK embarrassing -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer '' . END
griffith looked UNK to the captain ; ; END
it would be just like him . END
`` why not '' ? ? END
`` he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill the p.m. '' . END
docherty went taut : was it possible ? ? END
could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared ? ? END
not possible , he thought ; ; END
the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ; END
he wasn't going to allow himself to be led UNK to the slaughter . END
and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man , he wouldn't dare try anything now -- not after docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well . END
docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck . END
one more UNK play like that one and they'd be leading him away . END
still , this had to be checked out . END
`` where'd your friend hoag get his information '' ? ? END
`` haven't the UNK , captain '' . END
`` would you mind sending him up here ? ? END
i'd like to talk to him '' . END
troubled , he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around . END
but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building . END
he was unwilling to rely on UNK carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it . END
if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street . END
he would have to do something on his own . END
the door opened and three men and a woman in a UNK swept past him and down the stairs . END
in the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their UNK . END
these were the early departures ; ; END
in half an hour the reception would be over . END
if mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes . END
hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building . END
wide windows with many small UNK UNK swept across the upper stories . END
on the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; ; END
the scene looked like a christmas card . END
on the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; ; END
it was framed in UNK UNK , and no faces were visible . END
this would be mahzeer's office . END
he and the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at mahzeer's desk ; ; END
they would be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting . END
in a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; ; END
mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow . END
mahzeer would direct the prime UNK attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side . END
the single shot would come ; ; END
hoag would carry its sound to his grave . END
mahzeer , of course , would be desolate . END
how was he to suspect that an assassin had been UNK somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? ? END
where across the street ? ? END
where was muller waiting with the rifle ? ? END
narrow UNK buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf . END
most of them could be eliminated ; ; END
UNK would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite . END
the UNK was generously set back from the building line ; ; END
if the angle of fire were too great the UNK buildings on either side would interfere . END
would the shot come from a roof ? ? END
he ran his eye along the roof UNK ; ; END
almost at once a figure UNK up . END
but UNK glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman . END
with a cop UNK the road muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at la UNK airport . END
hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk . END
from this side he could see farther into the UNK UNK window , but he saw no faces ; ; END
the UNK occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain . END
if only the latter were true . END
he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their UNK : one was a club -- that was out ; ; END
two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted . END
that left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next . END
he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the UNK . END
he quickly closed it again . END
he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ; END
that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance . END
he went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking UNK of a public UNK . END
on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; ; END
there were six apartments . END
the names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him . END
this was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for . END
he peered in the boxes themselves ; ; END
all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines . END
the occupants of apartment number 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a friday . END
had muller made the same deduction ? ? END
muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes . END
he opened the inner door ; ; END
the cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city , at this hour , housewives would be UNK over UNK . END
he climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate UNK , all that remained of the UNK beauty . END
he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . END
now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to UNK collection of keys ; ; END
fresh scars showed that the door had been UNK open . END
it had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; ; END
he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch . END
what was he to do now ? ? END
he had thought no further than finding muller . END
he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him -- that muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond UNK control . END
he could not break in on an armed man . END
he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop . END
was there time ? ? END
his thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door . END
hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room muller was faintly UNK against the window , the rifle still raised ; ; END
he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill . END
he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , UNK hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at UNK apartment . END
hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark . END
the room was bathed in light at the instant UNK second shot came . END
muller , UNK exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; END
his face wore a look of outrage . END
a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; END
a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him UNK heavily from the table . END
he was dead before his body made contact with the floor . END
hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to UNK . END
after captain docherty sent UNK griffith for hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned , UNK up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne . END
the safe at UNK district station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain UNK office ( to the left ) , the UNK office ( farther along and to the left ) and the UNK supply closet ( straight ahead ) . END
the safe is a repository for three dead flashlight UNK , a hundred and fifty UNK left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of UNK UNK ball tickets from last year , and UNK cents in coins and stamps . END
gun set the captain's fifth of UNK walker inside the safe before he reported to lt. killpath , though he knew that killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any UNK UNK on herman UNK gift . END
it was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of killpath's goddam business . END
he walked up to the UNK office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a UNK gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range . END
he stared at the clerk who sat at a UNK and ancient UNK desk UNK UNK . END
`` where's the UNK '' ? ? END
the clerk UNK his head toward the captain's office . END
gun went to the connecting door , which was open , and stood at attention while orville UNK killpath , in full uniform , finished UNK his hair . END
the UNK sparse brown hair was heavily UNK , and as killpath raked the comb through it , it stuck together in UNK so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink UNK . END
the lieutenant eyed UNK reflection in the mirror over the UNK and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head . END
leave me alone , gun thought . END
fight with sam UNK , fight with the whole damned bureau . END
but leave me alone . END
because i'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man , and i'm going to get him . END
if you just leave me to hell alone , lieutenant . END
killpath peered through UNK lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and UNK . END
gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window . END
he sat UNK in a chair that did not swivel , though it was obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair . END
the desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof UNK of countless seasons . END
killpath pulled one thin leg up , UNK his arms around the UNK to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny UNK . END
it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath UNK his ulcer . END
he put his chin on his UNK , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared UNK at his sergeant . END
the UNK bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch . END
finally , orville intoned through his hawk nose , `` we can't have people running in any time they please , sergeant '' . END
`` no , sir '' . END
`` running in , running out . END
makes for confusion and congestion '' . END
he rocked back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his UNK eyes fixed on matson . END
he was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the UNK . END
roll was being called . END
gun cleared his throat . END
killpath said , `` you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , sergeant . END
that's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ? ? END
`` no , sir '' . END
gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time . END
the UNK platoon commander , lt. UNK , was calling out the beat assignments , but matson couldn't make the names mean anything . END
`` i called the station at three this morning '' , killpath's UNK voice pronounced . END
`` do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time '' ? ? END
`` sergeant UNK , sir '' . END
`` now , now , you're just guessing , sergeant '' . END
he smiled UNK , UNK his joke . END
`` what if i said nobody was here but a couple of UNK '' ? ? END
`` sir , UNK knows better than to leave the station without a relief . END
he must have '' -- END
`` he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station UNK . END
now that's not regulation , is it '' ? ? END
`` no , sir '' . END
`` but you didn't know a thing about it , did you '' ? ? END
killpath leaned forward ; ; END
his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now . END
`` that's not taking one's command with a responsible attitude , matson '' . END
gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool . END
but stupidity was no UNK when it had rank . END
`` i was out in the district , sir '' . END
`` oh , yes . END
so i have heard '' . END
he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk . END
`` i might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped '' . END
he took up a white sheet of paper , dark with UNK data . END
a car pulled into the driveway outside the window . END
gun knew it was car 12 , the wagon , returned from delivering UNK UNK to the city jail . END
but for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail . END
he stared at the report in killpath's hand , sure it was written by accacia -- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled UNK . END
he sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the UNK stems of his glasses around his ears and then , UNK the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` acting lieutenant UNK matson one failed to see that the station UNK was properly relieved two UNK himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section UNK three permitted members of the homicide detail of the UNK bureau to UNK for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain o. t. killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five UNK UNK establishments known as UNK spots for purposes of an unofficial and UNK social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered . END
what have you to say to that , sergeant '' ? ? END
killpath sailed the paper across the desk , but matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it . END
`` well '' ? ? END
`` i didn't think accacia knew so many big words , lieutenant '' . END
killpath licked his lips . END
`` patrolman accacia is an alert and conscientious UNK officer . END
i don't think his UNK UNK your negligence , matson '' . END
`` negligence , hell '' ! ! END
gun held his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the UNK in his throat . END
i would have been UNK and a goddam lousy cop to boot , if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district . END
it's too bad i didn't call you , and it's too bad i let UNK use accacia when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure . END
but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people i know in the places they hang around , and '' -- END
`` let's not push our patience beyond the danger line , sergeant '' , killpath UNK . END
`` i shouldn't like to have to write you up for UNK as well as UNK of duty '' . END
gun stiffened , his hands UNK into fists at his sides . END
he clamped his jaws to keep the fury from UNK out . END
an argument with orville UNK killpath was as UNK and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range . END
killpath leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee . END
`` let's just remember , sergeant , that we must all carry our own umbrella . END
a district station can't run smoothly , unless '' -- he interrupted himself , looking around gun at the doorway . END
`` morning , lieutenant UNK '' . END
`` sorry , orville . END
i thought you hadn't come in yet '' . END
`` i've been here for some time '' . END
he stood up , cocked his head and eyed gun coldly . END
`` the sergeant is just leaving '' . END
it had come as no great surprise to matson that the hot water in the UNK didn't work , that UNK severe had thrown up all over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes . END
it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in killpath's office . END
now , as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good night to the station UNK and his clerks , not stopping to hear the UNK UNK of his chewing out . END
not that he gave a damn what the UNK sent out about killpath's little speech on the UNK of platoon commanders . END
he just didn't want to talk about it . END
if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , killpath would just have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour ; ; END
because he'd be damned if he was going to be a UNK UNK just to please his UNK UNK captain . END
at the doorway he UNK up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he'd left them at the UNK . END
he could pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home . END
but even before he started across the UNK road to his plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station , he knew that he wasn't going home . END
it was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night . END
mission street at this hour was populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his tour of duty -- the neighborhood that had known UNK UNK by day . END
UNK phillips had purchased the alliance furniture UNK seventeen years ago . END
it was UNK worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will , and the name was written in gold in UNK letters across each of the two display windows . END
on the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was UNK , UNK , and under that , se UNK UNK . END
mr. phillips took a razor to UNK , UNK , but left the promise that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish UNK would be welcome . END
language was no problem anyway ; ; END
mr. phillips had only to signal from his doorway to UNK aid from the UNK UNK children who played on the sidewalks of mission street . END
aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one UNK was not the most enterprising , mr. phillips had no worries at all , and he said as much to gun matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK special ! ! END
`` she's honest as the day '' , mr. phillips said , and added , `` mr. UNK , i can say this to you : beebe is a little too honest . END
you can't tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to UNK his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down ! ! END
a time plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' -- he interrupted himself , smiling . END
`` i put her in lamps . END
that way i don't lose so much '' . END
`` why don't you just hire somebody else '' ? ? END
`` she says she has to finish a story '' . END
`` i asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go '' . END
casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . END
his name was george needham and he , too , had come from a good family . END
he was perhaps UNK , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave . END
he was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good UNK schools and a proper university . END
an only child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father UNK him by dying broke . END
since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling . END
all this went through UNK mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all . END
for he had understood that UNK had been engaged to a boy named UNK jenkins . END
she had grown up with young jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice . END
he wanted to ask her about jenkins now , but he knew he couldn't do so in UNK presence . END
and so , still wondering and a little UNK , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding . END
`` where did you pick him up '' ? ? END
`` oh , i've known him quite a while '' . END
she glanced at her companion fondly . END
`` haven't i , george '' ? ? END
`` i've been after her for years '' , needham said , `` but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days '' . END
the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched UNK hand . END
`` can i tell you a secret ? ? END
we're going to get married . END
do you approve '' ? ? END
casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl . END
he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from UNK estate to subsidize him . END
none of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand . END
he made a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond UNK . END
`` i'll have to give it some thought '' , he said . END
`` you wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable , would you '' ? ? END
she made a face at him and then she laughed . END
`` of course not '' . END
`` i'll get my references in order '' , needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused . END
`` stop by any time , casey '' . END
he stood up and touched the girl's arm . END
`` come on , darling . END
if you're really serious about working on that story , i'd better take you home '' . END
casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then UNK the matter as he called for his check . END
as he went out he told UNK the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from nancy parks and put a UNK piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her UNK . END
a taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment . END
because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if jerry UNK car was still there . END
in fact , he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him . END
only then , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . END
even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton , the pillow , the sheet of paper on top of it . END
then he was UNK across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note . END
look in the UNK . END
i knew the only way i could beat you was to play UNK , but it was a good try , kid , and i appreciate it . END
the UNK stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened . END
the discarded papers inside were UNK , there was a UNK of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct . END
he put the basket down UNK , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so UNK . END
for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself . END
for another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ; END
then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications UNK him . END
it no longer mattered that burton had UNK him . END
the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a UNK with a gun in his pocket . END
and that gun was empty . END
even before his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver . END
he considered them with brooding eyes , brows bunched as his brain UNK with the problem and tried to find some solution . END
he said : `` the crazy fool '' , half aloud . END
he put the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them . END
he thought : where the hell could he have gone ? ? END
how can i find him ? ? END
there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control . END
he tried to tell himself that maybe burton had UNK up enough to get some sense . END
maybe he only intended to UNK the UNK , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough . END
he thought of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton . END
then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang UNK to UNK the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly . END
`` yeah '' , he said . END
`` casey '' ? ? END
`` tony calenda '' . END
casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental UNK and control the disturbance inside his head . END
when he heard calenda say : `` what about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? ? END
it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for frank UNK . END
`` what picture '' ? ? END
`` you took a picture of me at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon '' . END
`` who says so '' ? ? END
`` one of my boys '' . END
casey believed that much . END
calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand . END
`` so '' ? ? END
`` with my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that picture published '' . END
`` who says it's going to be published '' ? ? END
`` i wouldn't even want it to get around '' . END
under normal circumstances casey was a little UNK when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken . END
even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly . END
right now , however , he was still too worried about jerry burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story burton had told him , to care too much about tony calenda . END
his nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice . END
`` look '' , he said . END
`` i was hired to take a picture . END
that's all i know about it and that's all i care '' . END
`` maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said '' . END
`` you tell him '' . END
`` all right '' , calenda said , his voice still quiet . END
`` but i meant what i said , casey . END
if that picture gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it , i'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you '' . END
`` you do that '' , casey said . END
`` just be sure to send your two best boys , tony '' . END
he hung up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create . END
as soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry UNK home number . END
he UNK it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up . END
he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton up that afternoon . END
when he was told that no one had seen burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities . END
each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up . END
by the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down . END
he had done all he could and that was that . END
and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk . END
he , casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible . END
he should have stayed here and watched burton . END
so he made a mistake . END
he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink . END
only then did he decide he didn't want one . END
he considered opening a can of beer but UNK that idea too . END
finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes . END
he had just finished UNK the right one when the telephone rang again . END
when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent . END
you don't know me but i know you . END
if you want a picture get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can . END
if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' . END
casey heard the UNK of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision . END
for over the years he had received many such calls . END
some of them came from people who identified themselves . END
some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past . END
others because they expected some sort of reward for the information . END
a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break . END
only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time . END
he was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from columbus avenue . END
it was a district of small factories and UNK buildings and occasional UNK , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes . END
he did not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned . END
the police car had pulled up behind a small UNK , its headlights still on . END
slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart . END
`` we're out just a little too far . END
make a 90 degree straight for shore '' . END
poet came in , raising his eyebrows UNK as he saw elaine . END
`` now '' ? ? END
`` pretty quick '' , she replied . END
`` will you drop the anchor '' ? ? END
poet nodded , swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor . END
the rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat UNK into the null on the aj . END
`` reverse '' , elaine said , then peered through the loop of the UNK and waved to poet . END
a second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor . END
she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore . END
nick watched her somewhat UNK as she efficiently cut the engines , and started the auxiliary motor . END
poet came up from below , wearing new bathing trunks . END
the price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the UNK and looked at it curiously . END
nick wondered if elaine had bought them , but he said nothing . END
nobody , he suddenly realized , was saying anything . END
it seemed as if they were all under a spell . END
there should be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years . END
but instead of chatter there was a null , like on the radio direction UNK . END
once , in new york , he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine . END
they had all been laughing , joking , when suddenly the engine had failed . END
no one had screamed . END
no one had prayed . END
all had fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind whistle over the wings . END
the pilot had been good . END
he'd landed the plane on a small UNK in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had UNK to a stop , everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment . END
there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent ; ; END
a tension similar to the one now . END
but in the plane there was a concrete reason for it . END
now , at this moment , there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe . END
the same UNK relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat . END
it hung over them like a cloud , its arrival as sudden as a cloud UNK over the sun . END
silently , elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit , poet behind her , nick trailing behind him . END
she threw back a cushion over one of the seats , unlocked a UNK on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand . END
poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun . END
`` UNK '' ? ? END
`` they are the best '' . END
she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion . END
`` they are the most efficient '' . END
`` and the UNK '' , poet commented as he UNK on his tank harness . END
`` why do you need an UNK '' ? ? END
nick asked , apprehensively , staring at the weapon . END
`` it's quite possible there's more than UNK down there , man '' , poet replied with a short , nervous laugh as he held the harness for elaine . END
a moment later , moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to poet , then rolled off the transom of the boat , back first . END
poet nodded to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion . END
another moment and they were out of sight , leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts . END
for a while nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles , wondering which set came from elaine . END
they remained close together , their air trail UNK like UNK traveling side by side . END
eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface , and he rolled over on his back . END
clasping his hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky . END
there was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean . END
UNK certainly must have enjoyed being alone . END
next to the ocean , probably the UNK spot was the desert . END
if UNK uncle had stuck to this desire for UNK , he probably would still be alive . END
yet UNK wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts . END
and graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las vegas . END
it was an odd combination a strange pair to UNK upon the wreck of the UNK . END
but graham hadn't stumbled on it . END
two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia , graham had been UNK around the san luis UNK mission . END
the small UNK with its two steel UNK UNK UNK and nick raised up to watch it heading south . END
that was a hell of a note , he thought . END
a couple couldn't even find a UNK spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone UNK down upon them . END
if the character flying that thing had gone over san UNK island yesterday he would have had an UNK . END
off to the west a beautiful UNK slowly beat its way into the wind , headed on a tack toward san UNK . END
behind it a cabin cruiser drifted UNK in the small UNK , a lone fisherman in the chair aft . END
the fisherman was right in the middle of the deep . END
nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in southern california were over the la UNK deep and the UNK deep , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline . END
someday , UNK had warned , the land on both sides of these UNK would fall into the ocean and no more la UNK or UNK beach . END
meanwhile , fishermen took advantage of them to pull up UNK . END
sometimes the fish exploded as they UNK the surface because of the difference in pressure . END
why , he wondered , had elaine wanted him along on this trip ? ? END
he couldn't UNK , he couldn't run a boat , except on the open sea . END
he stood up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none . END
strolling down to the galley , he lit the UNK under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the UNK . END
turning on the UNK , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the UNK and listened to the music . END
elaine and poet returned together , popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water . END
he sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern . END
`` any luck '' ? ? END
poet shook his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead . END
`` we're right on the edge of the deep '' , elaine said . END
pulling off her face mask , she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern , then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water . END
`` which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile '' , she added as she swung her legs over the transom . END
`` any news '' ? ? END
`` not a thing '' . END
he tossed her a towel , then repeated the service for poet . END
`` cigarette '' ? ? END
elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness , but poet nodded . END
his feet still hung over the stern of the transom , but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in . END
the UNK on his foot caught on the UNK , throwing him off balance . END
his UNK smashed painfully into the narrow UNK and he UNK as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
the word UNK distinctly from poet's lips as he struggled to his feet . END
nick's body became rigid . END
turning slowly he saw poet in a brilliant glare of horror . END
his face was still UNK in pain as he studied the underside of his arm . END
poet a murderer ? ? END
turning quickly toward elaine , nick saw that she , too , stood in shocked surprise . END
the sudden silence was too silent . END
instinctively aware of the charged atmosphere , poet raised his head slowly , looking first at elaine . END
she had caught the implication of the oath . END
her face was frozen into the mask of a UNK , her body absolutely motionless . END
and then nick knew that all of them knew elaine , himself and poet . END
elaine recovered first , so quickly that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction . END
`` do you need a bandage '' ? ? END
poet rubbed his arm . END
`` it's like banging a UNK '' , he said , his eyes UNK on nick's face , then moved back to elaine . END
`` hurts like hell for a second , then it UNK '' . END
`` i'll get some UNK '' . END
elaine turned and started toward the UNK . END
but her walk was too steady , too slow , UNK her fear . END
UNK like a cat , he leaped back , swooped up the spring gun and , whirling , pointed it toward the cabin . END
at the same instant , nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man . END
the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious UNK like the first stroke of an old steam engine . END
at the same instant , elaine screamed wildly , the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic , struggling poet . END
the moment the sea closed over nick , some UNK sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic . END
but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage . END
the wide UNK on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power , driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over . END
poet was the captured , arms UNK to his side , and he twisted UNK trying to escape . END
poet would escape , nick thought grimly , because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water . END
but nick would not let go . END
the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's forehead , bounced UNK off nick's chin , then disappeared . END
poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , UNK off the skin . END
for a split second , nick relaxed his grip and poet's slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop him , holding him now from the rear . END
something UNK at the side of nick's head as they rolled around and around . END
suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water , not rising , not sinking . END
a sharp pain UNK across nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs , joining dozens of others that sailed UNK toward the surface like helium UNK rising into the sky . END
a black , UNK object swayed UNK in front of him , UNK bubbles from its flat UNK head . END
the air hose was free ! ! END
the discovery struck nick like a blow . END
desperately , nick flashed one hand up , catching poet's neck in the bend of his elbow . END
at the same instant , he grabbed the loose , writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece . END
instinctively he UNK through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose . END
at once the UNK pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild UNK . END
as if this was a signal , poet abruptly began to UNK the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water . END
relentlessly , nick held on , sucking on the hose , UNK the air that belonged to poet . END
poet was not fighting nick now . END
harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a UNK UNK . END
it's a rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents , not enough tourists or working UNK . END
it's at the far end of the county and the last time i came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago . END
chief bob moore looked his same UNK ; ; END
a man mountain running to lard in his UNK . END
seeing me he said with real surprise , `` well , well , ain't we honored ! ! END
hardly expected the head of county homicide up for this murder . END
you sure climbed fast , jed . END
rookie investigator last summer and now it's inspector jed . END
took me 19 years to become chief of our three man police force . END
proves a college education pays off '' . END
his UNK was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth . END
`` i guess it helps '' , i said , paying no attention to his UNK . END
`` never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , jed . END
you're not only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer . END
a UNK with narrow shoulders and that brush UNK hell , you'd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the UNK set . END
in my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough . END
man , when my 275 pounds and UNK comes along , why it's the same as another badge . END
when i say move , a guy moves '' ! ! END
`` don't worry about my being tough , moore . END
also , it's far too early in the day for UNK lines like the bigger they come you've had your UNK lecture , let's get to work . END
who was the murdered woman mrs. buck '' ? ? END
`` widow , nice sort of woman . END
ran a UNK farm . END
came to the harbor as a bride and don't worry jed , this one is in the bag . END
i know the killer , have the only road off the peninsula covered '' . END
`` yeah , passed your road block as i drove in '' , i said , sitting on his polished desk . END
although bob dressed like a slob , he kept a neat office . END
`` okay , what happened '' ? ? END
`` about nine this morning mrs. buck phones me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble . END
colored fellow named tim williams -- only hand she has working for her now . END
tim come with the UNK workers that follow the crops up from the south last year , but tim and his wife settled here . END
never had no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , UNK around to get a full week's work . END
anyway , julia asks me to . END
`` julia '' ? ? END
`` come on , inspector , look alive . END
julia buck , the deceased '' , moore said , slipping me his smug , UNK again . END
`` julia asks me to come out at once . END
but she didn't sound real alarmed you know , like there was any immediate danger . END
i got there at UNK a.m. , found her strangled . END
i would have come sooner if i'd known . END
no doubt about tim being the killer -- i have a witness . END
don't know why the county had to send anybody up here . END
told them i can handle this '' . END
`` yeah , seems you have a nice package , with all the strings tied . END
`` i'll collar tim before night '' . END
`` who's your witness '' ? ? END
`` julia had -- has -- an old indian woman cooking for her -- nellie harris . END
probably the last of the original island indians . END
nellie was in the kitchen , had just come to work , when she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room . END
UNK she recognized his voice , that tim yelled , ' it's my money and i want it ' ! ! END
and then rushed out of the house . END
then she heard julia phone me . END
nellie went on with her house work -- until i found julia dead . END
and before you say it , nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled julia . END
there's no doubt this tim sneaked back and killed mrs. buck . END
another fact : UNK disappeared -- on the run . END
but there's no way off the point except through my road block . END
guess you want to see the body -- have her up the street in doc UNK office '' . END
`` let's see it '' . END
we walked up main street to this big white house , then around to the back . END
being the UNK sole doctor , abel was also its medical examiner . END
the corpse was on a table , covered by a sheet . END
doc abel was busy up front with some of his live patients . END
pulling back the sheet , i examined the bruises around julia UNK once slender throat . END
powerful hands had killed her . END
`` find any prints '' ? ? END
chief moore shook his big head , seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body . END
then he said , `` never noticed it before i mean , when she was dressed but for a woman her age , julia had a real fine figure '' . END
i dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch . END
it was almost one and i hadn't had lunch . END
still , i wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office . END
i told him , `` i want to go see the buck house '' . END
walking back down main street , i said , `` i saw the UNK one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car '' . END
`` UNK , we'll use mine '' , moore said , opening the door of a UNK white jaguar UNK . END
as i slid in beside him he said , `` some heap , hey ? ? END
got a UNK of a buy on this , dirt cheap '' . END
`` yeah , it's a real load '' , i told him , looking up the street at my battered ford . END
five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house , and when the jaguar stopped i managed to swallow . END
there was a garage and a modern barn in the rear , all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes . END
everything shouted gentleman farming , the kind of UNK UNK money the point is known for . END
the fins of a UNK were sticking out of the garage , while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture . END
nellie harris wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny UNK woman with a face like a tan UNK . END
she was also stone deaf in her right ear . END
she calmly repeated what moore had told me . END
when i asked , `` why didn't you go into the living room to see how mrs. buck was '' ? ? END
the old gal stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` she didn't call . END
i do the living room last . END
i went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way i always do in the morning '' . END
`` have you any idea what this tim and mrs. buck were arguing about '' ? ? END
miss julia was a hard woman with a dollar . END
years ago when i asked her to put me in social security , so's i wouldn't have to be working now , miss julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her '' . END
`` did you hear tim return '' ? ? END
nobody came until chief moore '' . END
i UNK on the kitchen table with my pencil . END
`` mrs. buck have any men friends '' ? ? END
`` her '' ? ? END
the wrinkled mouth laughed , revealing astonishingly strong , white , teeth . END
`` i never see none . END
but then i wasn't her social secretary '' . END
`` was she on friendly terms with other members of her family '' ? ? END
`` didn't have no family -- around here . END
they had a son -- killed in the war '' . END
i walked into the living room . END
there didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle . END
i told moore , `` where does UNK wife live '' ? ? END
`` i'll take you there . END
look jed , this is an open and shut case and i have to relieve my men at the road block soon . END
okay , come on '' . END
we did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of UNK . END
in late summer UNK workers lived five and six to a room in these . END
now they were empty , except for a cottage across the road . END
mrs. tim williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter chocolate , and if you UNK the plain dress and worn slippers , she was startlingly pretty . END
the inside of their place was full of new furniture , five bucks down and a buck a week stuff , but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home . END
mrs. williams was both sullen and frightened . END
she said she didn't know a thing -- tim had left the house at six in the morning , as usual . END
she hadn't seen him since . END
`` did mrs. buck owe him any wages '' ? ? END
`` well , for this week , but they wasn't due UNK saturday . END
listen , mr. inspector , no matter what anybody say , my tim didn't kill that woman ! ! END
tim is a good man , hard working . END
he strong as a bull but gentle as a baby . END
even if he angry , tim wouldn't hurt a woman . END
he never in his life took a hand to a woman or '' END
`` we'll get him soon , see what he says '' , chief moore cut in . END
`` does your husband have a car '' ? ? END
`` got us an old station wagon . END
need it for the job '' . END
i asked a silly question : `` you've no idea where your husband could be , now '' ? ? END
she shook her head . END
i knew she was lying . END
i stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty . END
moore said , `` come on , jed , i have to get to my men '' . END
on my way out i told her , `` if you should eh just happen to see your husband , get him to give himself up . END
he'll get a fair trial . END
hiding out like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet '' . END
i'll tell him -- if i see him '' . END
we made it back to the harbor in less than four minutes . END
i tried not to act scared . END
that jaguar could really barrel along . END
i told moore i was going to eat , get some forms filled out by doc abel . END
chief moore said , `` if i don't see you when i return , see you for certain at my road block , inspector '' . END
i had a bowl of decent UNK , phoned the doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour . END
lighting my pipe , i took a walk . END
the harbor is a big UNK basin in the summer . END
even now , there were several slick UNK tied to the dock , an UNK UNK anchored inside the UNK . END
there was a 34 foot wheeler with chief UNK in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock . END
it wasn't a new boat , about five years old , but fitted with fishing UNK and chairs . END
i asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was UNK . END
he said , `` you bet . END
bob moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing '' . END
i dropped into the doctor's office , picked up my forms . END
as i was walking back to the police station , which was in the same building with the city hall and post office , i saw mrs. tim williams UNK into the back of my car . END
if she moved gracefully , she was clumsy at it . END
i got into the front seat . END
she was ' hiding ' on the floor of the back seat , the soft curves of her back and hips -- rousing lines . END
i drove out of the harbor , turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped . END
i waited a few minutes and she sat up . END
for another moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep . END
she mumbled , `` i just know that chief moore is out to kill my tim '' ! ! END
i never saw him so anxious before '' , i said , lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette . END
`` of course , it could be because this is his first murder case . END
you know where tim is , don't you , mrs. williams '' ? ? END
she puffed on the cigarette slowly , sitting slumped against the back seat ; ; END
but the police have dropped the case . END
i want you to go to pearson city and find out why -- UNK stuff for your modern crime series . END
take the same train diana beauclerk took and get there at the same time . END
go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite -- 1105 '' . END
`` will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime '' ? ? END
`` why not ? ? END
the police have finished with it . END
besides , the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper . END
to the hotel people , you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite '' . END
`` still , they may not want to rent it '' . END
`` that's your headache . END
once inside , keep your eyes open '' ! ! END
`` for what '' ! ! END
alec was growing more and more skeptical . END
`` the police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a UNK comb . END
the hotel people will have UNK and UNK it . END
ten to one , it's even been UNK '' ! ! END
`` there's always a chance they may have overlooked something '' , returned the chief . END
`` i'm betting on that chance . END
interview the bellboy and UNK who waited on beauclerk . END
study the topography of the suite . END
soak up local color . END
UNK everything beauclerk did . END
try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive '' . END
`` cheerful way to spend an evening '' ! ! END
a sudden thought wiped the UNK from his face . END
`` suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime '' ! ! END
the UNK eyes gleamed . END
`` that is exactly what i'm hoping for . END
after all , the murderer is still at large . END
and the key to the suite is still missing '' . END
on the train alec refreshed his memory of the beauclerk case by reading UNK UNK -- UNK stories about the crime sent out by the pearson city star , a member of the syndicate press . END
diana beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in new york . END
two weeks ago she had gone west to pearson city . END
daniel forbes , her divorced husband , lived there . END
so did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce , UNK and stacy . END
she reached pearson city at nine p.m. and went straight to the hotel UNK . END
she telephoned the junior partner of her law firm , martin stacy , and asked him to call at her hotel that evening . END
at the time of her divorce forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further UNK if she UNK . END
according to stacy , she told him she was planning to UNK and she wanted him to ask forbes for the lump sum . END
stacy replied that it would bankrupt forbes , who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture . END
stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m. . END
she was in good health and spirits , but still determined to get the money from forbes . END
no one saw stacy leave . END
no other visitor inquired for her that evening . END
next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a END
colt revolver in her brain . END
according to the medical examiner , she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m. . END
her door was locked and the key was missing . END
so was the gun . END
when alec finished reading he was sure that either forbes or stacy had killed diana beauclerk . END
forbes had motive and stacy had opportunity . END
find a motive for stacy or an opportunity for forbes and the case would be solved . END
the hotel UNK proved to be one of the older hotels in pearson city , and definitely second-rate . END
alec's first impression of the lobby was UNK , victorian dignity -- black walnut and red UNK , a black and white tiled floor , and persian rugs . END
he studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary . END
`` i'd like the room i had the last time '' . END
`` certainly , sir '' . END
the clerk was young and limp , with a tired smile . END
`` do you recall the number '' ? ? END
`` it was 1105 '' . END
the clerk's smile congealed . END
`` that suite is taken '' . END
alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk . END
opposite the number 1105 stood one word : UNK . END
the clerk's glance followed alec's . END
`` we have better rooms vacant now '' , he UNK . END
`` larger and more comfortable . END
at the same rate '' . END
alec's face was dark , blunt , and sulky . END
he always looked UNK and he could look dangerous . END
he was looking dangerous now . END
he raised his voice . END
`` anything wrong with the plumbing in 1105 '' ? ? END
there was a sudden stillness in the lobby . END
two women , who had been chattering like UNK , were struck dumb . END
a man , lighting a match for his cigar , paused until the flame burned his fingers . END
even the UNK on their bench were listening . END
the clerk's eyes UNK . END
`` of course not '' ! ! END
`` anybody with a UNK disease been in there '' ? ? END
`` no '' ! ! END
the clerk was almost hysterical . END
`` it's just that -- well , 1105 is being UNK '' . END
`` i don't believe it '' . END
alec leaned on the desk , holding the clerk's eyes with his . END
`` suppose you tell me the real reason '' , he UNK . END
`` there might be a story in it '' . END
`` UNK '' ? ? END
`` i'm with the UNK press , feature service . END
either i get the story -- or i get the suite '' . END
it was UNK and the clerk knew it . END
`` there is no story '' , he UNK UNK . END
show this gentleman to 1105 '' ! ! END
the stillness persisted as alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator . END
he could feel eyes on his back . END
he wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly . END
the corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric UNK at intervals of thirty feet . END
a thick , crimson carpet muffled every UNK . END
at the end of the corridor alec noticed a door marked : fire stairs . END
it was a neat setup for murder . END
the bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105 . END
the room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window . END
a few UNK UNK down through that theatrical red glow , languid as falling feathers . END
hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light . END
the room looked normal and even commonplace . END
there was no hint of a violent struggle now . END
deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store . END
the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new . END
it had never been stained with blood . END
table covers and towels were clean , UNK empty and supplied with fresh matches . END
the mirror over the bureau was a blank eye , round and innocent . END
alec played the part of an innocent tourist . END
`` is there anything wrong with this room '' ? ? END
the boy dropped his eyes . END
`` afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut '' ? ? END
the boy raised his eyes . END
`` listen , mister . END
if you want my advice , pack up and take the next train back to new york '' . END
`` were you on duty here two weeks ago '' ? ? END
then , `` i'm not talking . END
but i wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks '' ! ! END
he was in a hurry to get out of the room . END
alec gave him a tip and let him go . END
alone , alec examined the doors . END
there were three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was UNK -- locked or bolted on the other side . END
alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table . END
it was just quarter of nine . END
as he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover . END
not gray like the dust that collects in an UNK room , but white . END
women didn't use white face powder nowadays , he recalled . END
they used pink , tan , or cream powder . END
alec glanced into the bathroom . END
blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands . END
it seemed clean now , but alec decided against a bath . END
he crawled into bed and switched off the light . END
in the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window . END
it winked as steadily as a UNK -- on , off -- on , off . END
in less than five minutes alec was asleep . END
he never knew just what woke him . END
yet suddenly he was UNK . END
there was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the UNK UNK of the red light on the wall . END
he lay still , listening to the silence , watching the light . END
somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight . END
according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m. . END
alec heard a faint sound . END
his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest . END
for the sound was inside the room . END
he let his eyelids UNK and breathed heavily , UNK sleep . END
the sound was coming nearer . END
a monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall , distorted and UNK . END
when the neon sign faded out , the shadow disappeared . END
when the neon sign flashed on , the shadow was still there . END
it stretched to an impossible height , climbing the wall to the ceiling . END
that meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light -- in this case , the window . END
cautiously alec UNK his muscles , ready to jump . END
the UNK betrayed him with a UNK . END
someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window . END
abandoning caution , alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch . END
before he could snap it on , a UNK blow caught him in the ribs . END
he UNK out blindly with his right . END
there was a thick , UNK crack of fist on flesh . END
something hard UNK his knuckles . END
he put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be . END
rough cloth UNK his fist . END
there was a UNK , curiously UNK , like that of an animal in pain . END
something heavy shook the floor as it dropped . END
alec waited a moment , on guard . END
again he groped for the light switch . END
the blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room . END
on the bare floorboards a man lay face down . END
he had a short , heavy , powerful body . END
alec turned him over and discovered a round , UNK face with narrow , slanting eyes -- a primitive UNK face from russia or the UNK . END
the man's shoes were too pointed , his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist . END
there was a slight bulge under the left UNK -- a shoulder holster . END
alec promptly removed the gun . END
he was familiar with this type . END
he had seen it in the UNK at police headquarters in new york , in broadway night clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms , in the criminal courts . END
but he was surprised to meet it here . END
diana beauclerk had no connection with the underworld . END
a professional UNK would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a END
nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a UNK ride on a lonely country road . END
the man's eyelids UNK . END
he opened his eyes . END
`` what are you doing here '' ? ? END
the man made no reply . END
his eyes were dazed . END
his lips were bruised and swollen where alec had hit him . END
`` did you kill diana beauclerk '' ? ? END
alec expected an indignant denial , but there was no response at all . END
`` oh , come on , snap out of it ! ! END
or i'll turn you over to the police '' ! ! END
the silence was getting on alec's nerves . END
the man opened his mouth , but no words came . END
only that curious , animal UNK alec had heard during their fight . END
`` don't you speak english '' ? ? END
the man opened his mouth wider . END
a forefinger pointed toward his UNK . END
alec leaned forward to look . END
there were hideous scars inside the throat and the UNK was UNK . END
in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality , to red UNK and handley walker , to murder and sudden death . END
but you realize , i am sure , how much old deeds UNK to new ones , and you must forgive me if i tell you first of the old ones . END
it was in UNK that abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on dogtown common , a desolate place even then . END
he was UNK his razor . END
`` sister '' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven '' ? ? END
and she answered , `` i don't know , but i hope you'll never do such a thing '' . END
without a UNK , `` god forbid '' ! ! END
he said , and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny day's swamp . END
what has this to do with the present ? ? END
much , i assure you . END
you must know what gets into people , even such as red and handley , before you can tell what comes out of them . END
they had learned , both of them , about abraham wharf . END
that's why i beg you not to forget him . END
his ghost is not laid . END
red and handley , god help them , knew the old dogtown lore ; ; END
and i knew they knew it , for i'd told them a lot of it . END
and isn't it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows ? ? END
yes , gentlemen , i am getting to the point , to my point . END
you know the facts ; ; END
they are set forth in your own newspapers . END
you want from me the story , but a story is about ' why ' and then , perhaps , about how . END
the ' when ' you know ; ; END
so what i am trying to tell you is the ' why ' -- that is my point -- and that concerns the spirit of the matter . END
there is an UNK and a UNK to old furniture ( look at that mahogany UNK behind you ) which has a provocative UNK , if i may say so . END
places , too , have their haunting qualities . END
and my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter . END
when you hold the spirit of a thing , then somehow you know the truth -- you know a fake antique from the real thing . END
and the truth is what you've come for , is it not ? ? END
now , dogtown is one of those places that UNK into the marrow as worms get into old wood , under the UNK . END
in fact , all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann , they are not just like others . END
there's a different UNK on them . END
there were no witch UNK here because everyone had a witch in the family . END
just think of old UNK UNK who pulled the teeth of dark younger ( her real name was UNK ) , and because he UNK the job and left two UNK UNK she put such a UNK on him that he thought his legs were made of glass . END
after that he was never known to run or even walk fast . END
today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england that i know of . END
there it sits , a small UNK , with towns like gloucester near by ; ; END
but now it's the most lost and tortured place in the world . END
those who lived in that desolation of rocky UNK took on some of the UNK stony character . END
scientists say it is the last UNK of a great UNK , but one rather feels that only a UNK giant could have piled up those UNK UNK of UNK which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended , ominous life in them . END
we'll walk up there later . END
it's perhaps a mile from here where we sit . END
and not one single dwelling left there , though once , in the early eighteenth century , there were close to a hundred houses . END
( i myself have identified about sixty sites , from the old maps and registers . END
a fascinating pursuit , i assure you . END
) even i can remember nothing but ruined UNK and tumbled pillars , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man . END
it is now a sweep of UNK and UNK , with oak , walnut and UNK creeping across the common , and everywhere the ruins and the long , long shadows . END
that's your setting , and a sinister one . END
please get that in your reports . END
it accounts for so many things . END
both red UNK and handley walker lived nearby , almost as near as i do . END
red lived at UNK , and from his house he could be up on the common in a half UNK brisk walk ; ; END
handley lived further on , at UNK UNK . END
i'd often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching . END
they were both painters , ( they were ? ? END
what should one say ? ? END
) well , anyhow , dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only sunday UNK still stray up there , from time to time . END
UNK , railroad , lack of water , killed dogtown . END
dead , dead as a brass door nail , and i sometimes feel like the UNK , for i'm about the last to be even interested . END
i knew red and handley well . END
as i said , they were both painters . END
they'd come , separately , to gloucester some twenty years ago -- there's always been an artists' colony somewhere on cape ann -- and each married here . END
they married cousins , anta and UNK norberg . END
there are a lot of UNK in this neck of the woods , and many still make painted furniture and take UNK . END
pretty girls among them , with blonde hair and UNK faces . END
handley married UNK and red , of the red beard , married anta . END
and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that i got to understand them all so well . END
the quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw , but i must tell you about it . END
oh , yes , i'm quite sure it's important , because of the beech pasture . END
why , that's what gave me the feeling , gave me UNK the spirit , the UNK , evil spirit of this whole affair . END
you see , besides being UNK of UNK , i am also UNK . END
no , i don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things . END
i know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the UNK she carries , where the live wind blows , and not from the hull . END
but you've got to know both . END
what's below the UNK interests me also . END
as i was saying , i've known all about the old records , including the old norberg deed . END
some ten years ago that page was torn out , i don't know by whom . END
about five years ago , handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register . END
he was courteous and casual about it , as though it were of no consequence . END
he's always like that , in spite of being a big man . END
( when you see him , you'll notice his habit of UNK , i might almost say , UNK a large mole with black hairs on it , by his right temple . END
) a sensual man , but very courteous , some would say slick . END
like his UNK black hair . END
too many outside manners , to my taste . END
he is the sort who , with an UNK eye , would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her . END
a real gentleman , i feel , would do neither . END
he's always worn a UNK hat , and i've noticed , in my small study at the society , that he rather smells of cosmetics . END
the next week , cousin red wandered in as casually , but curt and UNK . END
red was small and UNK , like UNK . END
he too asked to see the same page . END
when i told him someone had torn it out , he shouted . END
`` by god , it's that damn handley , the UNK '' ! ! END
and later in the same week they both came together to examine the register . END
fortunately we were alone in the building -- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days -- for they began to abuse each other in the UNK language . END
red thrusting out his tawny beard , handley UNK under his suddenly UNK black hair . END
le rouge et le UNK . END
red always was UNK , yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the two . END
but for my presence , they would have been at each UNK throats . END
during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was , from the UNK each hurled at the other . END
the beech pasture had suddenly become valuable . END
there's a fine UNK quarry there , and UNK coming back for public buildings . END
both men knew it was in the norberg family holdings , but to which of the cousins did it belong , anta or UNK ? ? END
fortunately , i knew almost exactly what the will had said . END
it began with a preamble , of course . END
this explained that the judge of UNK of essex county , UNK or UNK , appointed three UNK of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate . END
after the usual honorable UNK , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased UNK norberg , one lower room , on the western side , privileges to the well and UNK and to one third of the cellar ( i can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one cow right , and UNK they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as UNK , namely the beech pasture . END
and i remember that the whole of the privileges , not counting the beech pasture , was valued at twenty pounds . END
i wish you could have seen the UNK fall on these two UNK UNK when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly . END
that battle scene , ridiculous as it was , remained in my mind . END
a disturbing picture of bad blood , to be further heightened with UNK if UNK colors , for on a subsequent day i saw handley UNK anta , UNK wife , up on dogtown common . END
i felt it would be UNK to disclose my presence . END
not that i intentionally go UNK , but the UNK up there are very high and i am a small woman . END
one other cause of jealousy between them i must tell you . END
UNK and UNK as red UNK was , he was much the better painter . END
i suppose handley knew it . END
if red had a show at gloucester , handley would hurry to hang his pictures in UNK . END
you may say this has little UNK , but , gentlemen , remember that all this prepared my mind , UNK my intelligence . END
by such touches the pattern takes shape . END
you would call these the motives of crime . END
i would call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the designs of destiny . END
yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance to UNK our case , as you would call it , till yesterday . END
one month ago , on the 20th of october , was the opening of the UNK season in massachusetts . END
not much to shoot , but there are a few UNK . END
rabbits , too , if you care for them , which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate . END
any more than they have the sense to eat UNK . END
that was the day red was said to have gone away . END
oh yes , he'd talked about doing so . END
in fact , he often disappeared , from time to time , -- off to paint the sea , aboard a UNK out from gloucester . END
anta , his wife , never seemed to mind . END
i suppose these UNK gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin handley . END
anyhow , i wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back road . END
no , he didn't have his gun , which he should have . END
it would have been a good excuse for his being there at all . END
i myself had been up there by seven o'clock , after UNK , since there'd been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as sandwich glass . END
that's what the man had said . END
haney peered UNK at his drinking companion through UNK , UNK eyes . END
he had no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of UNK . END
was the man drunk or crazy or both ? ? END
but his UNK buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count , and the man's eyes were still clear . END
the guy is off his rocker , haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes . END
eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them . END
why hadn't he noticed it before ? ? END
no , the man was not drunk END
he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger . END
but , of course , he remembered now . END
it was blurred , after two hours of steady drinking , but the occasion of it came back to him . END
the stranger , his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection . END
brakes UNK and a horn UNK furiously , but the man would have been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before . END
his shout had been UNK , something anybody might have done without thinking , on the spur of the moment . END
as a matter of fact , he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit . END
actually , he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them . END
by then , the stranger was UNK haney UNK and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend . END
so the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his UNK record . END
then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face , without saying a word . END
very suddenly , the driver stopped UNK at them , turned on his heel and went back to his truck . END
haney hadn't given it much thought at the time . END
now he recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off . END
it must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word . END
when the light went their way , they went on across the street . END
and when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars , he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them . END
phil usually went alone and kept to himself , sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite UNK . END
but he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks , even though he made good money at his job . END
phil was like that . END
now he wondered if it was worth it , having a UNK for company . END
he really didn't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy . END
when he finally got the UNK under control , he realized that pete ( all he gave was his first name ) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare . END
haney managed a weak laugh . END
`` guess i can't think of anyone , pete . END
a faint UNK appeared between the man's eyebrows . END
`` i think you aren't taking me seriously , phil . END
and everybody has some kind of grudge . END
i might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you . END
i believe in returning favors . END
i'll do anything for somebody i like . END
it won't cost you a cent , phil . END
go ahead and try me '' ! ! END
phil rubbed his forehead wearily . END
he was beginning to feel UNK . END
maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit . END
he really didn't expect anything to come of it , and there were a few people END
`` all right '' , he conceded finally , `` if you must know , i don't get along with the landlord . END
he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio and sing while i'm taking a bath . END
he says the neighbors complain , but i don't believe it . END
why don't they tell me themselves if it UNK them '' ? ? END
the man closed his eyes and nodded . END
when he looked up again , he seemed almost contented . END
give me your address . END
it will take a little time . END
i want to study your UNK habits and movements first . END
you see , i always make it look like an accident . END
maybe suicide , if it looks reasonable . END
in that way there's no trouble for the customer '' . END
UNK eyebrows flew up . END
`` customer '' ? ? END
`` it's my line of work '' , he said END
five minutes later , before haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell . END
haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure . END
phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table . END
some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack , putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep . END
the next day , sunday , the UNK reminded haney where he had been the night before . END
the UNK in turn reminded him of his conversation with the UNK , and he UNK . END
he went for more UNK later in the day , and passed the UNK landlord on the way -- he was still alive and UNK as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life . END
phil shrugged and ignored him . END
he went back to work monday . END
by wednesday the landlord was still alive . END
of course on thursday , haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife UNK , and wished the stranger could do something about her END
coming home from work , he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building . END
inside the lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly . END
his spine crawled with a foreboding UNK as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened . END
the landlord had died . END
late that afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection . END
he had apparently been alone . END
nobody witnessed the fall -- just the UNK impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance . END
haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden UNK , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks . END
he muttered something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator . END
once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped UNK in a chair . END
after a while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions . END
but after all , why should they ? ? END
still later , he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence . END
the stranger really had nothing to do with it , of course END
haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord . END
after all , the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it . END
really , he said to himself , nobody kills a man just as a favor ! ! END
so you thought i didn't mean what i said . END
the UNK eyes were large and sad , as if phil haney had hurt his feelings . END
it was like a recurrent , annoying dream , but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare . END
however , haney knew it was not a dream . END
he might be very tight , but he knew where he was . END
it was the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual . END
he had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any talkative , friendly UNK . END
he was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet UNK with bourbon slightly UNK with water . END
this favorite UNK was not the landlord . END
he had already quite forgotten about him . END
in fact , he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment . END
his real UNK was UNK . END
toward the end of his fourth hairy highball , while he was UNK making wet rings on the UNK with the bottom of the glass , he became aware that he was not alone . END
he looked up with UNK eyes and UNK the stranger sitting across the table , smiling a secret smile at him , as if they were fellow conspirators . END
he hadn't even noticed -- what was his name ? ? END
-- he hadn't seen him sit down . END
the man was uncanny , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow . END
haney felt like UNK out of sight , but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry , dark little man . END
he began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing . END
was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a UNK ? ? END
he'd have to start going to some of the other places again . END
in a low voice , almost whispering , the man had asked phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back . END
he made the mistake of answering in an UNK way , and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice . END
pete frowned slightly , then became sad and moody . END
haney didn't want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble . END
but there was no trouble . END
the guy UNK over his drink , obviously upset by UNK lack of appreciation . END
to break the uncomfortable silence , haney began to talk . END
in time , and two drinks later , he was complaining bitterly about his wife , he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes . END
when he paused to UNK his throat , the stranger broke in . END
`` but why pay her bills ? ? END
if she runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her '' ? ? END
`` that bitch would love a divorce '' , he UNK . END
`` then she'd get half of everything i have . END
community property deal -- you know . END
i'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share . END
she can drop dead '' ! ! END
you must understand , i haven't been in this state too long . END
i came out here to retire . END
that's why i -- why i do a free job now and then . END
you should have told me about her before '' . END
haney felt a UNK of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again . END
then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain . END
suppose -- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was ! ! END
a retired professional killer if he was just a nut , no harm was done . END
but if he was the real thing , he could do something about UNK . END
he felt very cunning , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot . END
`` no offense intended '' , he said gently . END
`` but it's just that -- well , you know . END
the cops didn't suspect a thing , and i thought it was a coincidence . END
after all , i didn't know you , pete . END
it could have been an accident '' . END
`` but if you say you managed it '' the stranger was hooked . END
his eyes burned UNK . END
`` yes , yes '' , he muttered impatiently . END
`` of course it looked like an accident . END
i always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi . END
let me prove it , phil . END
i think i can manage one more favor for you '' . END
haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass . END
about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end , and went through . END
`` c'mon '' , he whispered ; ; END
`` floor UNK about three feet down , so don't fall '' . END
i went through and down , into pitch darkness . END
he said , `` jist stay still . END
i'll pull the boards back and then get us a light . END
jist stay where you are '' . END
i jist stayed where i was while he fumbled around and then walked away . END
a moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and i could see . END
it was a big room , empty except for a few things of UNK at the far end -- a wooden UNK on which stood the candle , a spread out blanket , and an UNK UNK . END
i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him ; ; END
he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through . END
i took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket . END
`` you first '' , i said . END
he drank and handed it back . END
`` nice place '' , i told him . END
`` listen , i got a buddy i travel with , real nice guy named larry . END
i know where he is , right near here . END
could he join the party and sleep here tonight too ? ? END
we'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you '' . END
he hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` UNK '' , and i reassured him . END
`` he'll bring a bottle too , and i'll get another one or maybe two while i'm out . END
you can work on this one while i'm gone , kill it if you want '' . END
i took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him . END
his `` UNK '' was enthusiastic this time . END
he put the bottle down . END
`` git over by the window while there's light , an' i'll put UNK candle out . END
when UNK come back i'll put it out UNK till you're both inside '' . END
charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front . END
`` perfect UNK '' , i told him . END
`` but we got to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two . END
on the way i'll give you the scoop '' . END
on the way i gave him the scoop . END
i bought another pint of sherry and when we got back pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again . END
i introduced my friend larry to pops and we made ourselves comfortable . END
there was still a little , not much , left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it , and charlie opened his . END
i was reminded , UNK , by a poem of kenneth patchen's called the murder of two men by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves , which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background . END
the poem consisted of only two words , the word `` wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections , and then the word `` now '' ! ! END
and a UNK final chord from the jazz group . END
this was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves . END
but we could wait all right ; ; END
there was no hurry . END
i said , `` wait wait '' to charlie and he grinned , digging the reference . END
we'd heard the record together once . END
the second bottle passed a few times . END
pops was taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet . END
he seemed as drunk as when i'd first talked to him , but no UNK . END
he had a capacity ; ; END
if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine . END
about halfway through the second bottle , charlie looked at me across pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` now '' ? ? END
i said , `` wait '' , and handed the bottle to pops for his final drink . END
when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely , pops was looking toward me and i said `` now '' , to charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once . END
it was a lead pipe UNK . END
there was a sound like the one you produce by UNK a UNK with your finger , only louder , and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise . END
out cold , if not dead ; ; END
and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him . END
i reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat , but charlie said `` wait '' ! ! END
-- and said it sharply , not as in the patchen bit , but as an order -- so i stopped my hand and looked at him . END
he was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me . END
`` we don't want to know whether he's dead , yet . END
i UNK that blow to be UNK . END
to UNK him and maybe or maybe not kill . END
you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not . END
that way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the UNK . END
i dug him , i saw his point ; ; END
i took the piece of pipe from UNK hand and used it , harder than he had . END
the UNK was louder , anyway , and i thought i heard bone crack . END
charlie said , `` good boy . END
that did it , if mine didn't . END
and we'll never know which . END
all right , now i'll give you a hand '' . END
we straightened pops up and i made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat . END
i nodded to charlie . END
`` let's put him down again the way he was . END
it's a more natural position '' . END
`` how do you feel '' ? ? END
`` cool '' , i told him . END
`` what do you feel '' ? ? END
well maybe i'm exaggerating . END
it was a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for stakes . END
but let's not talk about it UNK until we're out of here . END
now , first question : the bottles . END
shall we take them all with us , or leave one '' ? ? END
`` take them '' , i said . END
`` if we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints . END
here's the picture we want to leave for the UNK -- whenever the body gets found . END
this happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum . END
if they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him '' . END
and he'd have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that . END
now '' -- he looked around . END
`` i've been careful about fingerprints . END
how about you '' ? ? END
there are the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take prints . END
same goes for the rough cement of the ledge . END
besides , i doubt if the cops will even try dusting . END
they find dead UNK every day , maybe they won't even UNK him for the cause of death '' . END
`` we can't take a chance on that . END
we've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent . END
our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets . END
let's do that '' . END
we did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change . END
we took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change . END
we discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out . END
the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the UNK when it UNK out . END
a fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner . END
he might not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise . END
we went once more over every point , then UNK . END
being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop . END
in fact , nobody saw us , cop or citizen . END
UNK is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour . END
which , if it matters , was one a.m. . END
less than three hours ago we'd decided , in UNK wells's pad on UNK , to commit a trial murder . END
it had gone like UNK . END
almost too smoothly , i found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous . END
how safe is too safe ? ? END
thinking like that can get you into a padded pad . END
an hour later we were back in my UNK pad , killing what had been left of the second pint . END
we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow . END
also our plans for me to commit UNK murder and for him to commit mine . END
but we were really going to do it . END
we shook hands on it . END
we planned ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could UNK notes . END
i'd tell him everything i'd learned about UNK habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on radic . END
we made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at UNK wells's pad . END
charlie would get there early because he had the key . END
from here on in , the less charlie and i were seen together in public , or visited one another's rooms , the better . END
i was dead tired and slept UNK , as far as i know UNK . END
we met at UNK and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out . END
charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks . END
i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking . END
i talked first , telling him everything i knew about UNK and his house and domestic arrangements . END
i drew diagrams and floor plans ; ; END
he UNK them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down . END
he gave me equivalent and even more detailed UNK on radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building radic lived in and one of the apartment itself . END
he'd been there several times , back when , while he and radic had been friends , or at least not enemies . END
it didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ; END
it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie said , `` well , i guess that's it . END
shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first ? ? END
or would you rather deal a hand of UNK poker or play a game of gin UNK , or what '' ? ? END
`` wait a minute , charlie '' , i said . END
`` one thing we haven't discussed , expense money . END
we'll need some at least , if only bus fare to the scene of the crime . END
and if you're as flat broke as i am , i think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' . END
`` all right , i'll come clean . END
i've got a little UNK for a rainy day , and i guess this is rainy enough . END
a couple of hundred . END
if you draw the short straw i'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before i take off to visit my sister in UNK . END
then , after i'm back , another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy '' . END
`` solid '' , i said . END
i took a deep breath , and the plunge . END
`` in that case , let's not draw . END
i'll go to bat first . END
you'd have to wait till UNK back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris to have her have an alibi for UNK . END
so it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything . END
but your friend UNK can go any time '' . END
he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder . END
`` i was hoping you'd say that , willy . END
but i wouldn't have suggested it . END
well -- in that case , i take off tomorrow morning for UNK . END
and , in case , i brought the money with me '' . END
now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let . END
UNK integrity was and is and ever had been . END
mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many UNK on mars , corporate and UNK , the precious few on earth -- the unknown powers of three on earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself . END
mike remained in trance ; ; END
there was much to grok , loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the UNK foster UNK ( not just UNK when he and digby had come face to face alone ) why bishop senator UNK made him UNK uneasy , how miss dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had UNK grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing -- END
UNK conversations coming and going -- UNK words troubled him most ; ; END
he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a UNK , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in . END
the word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among UNK words gave him UNK difficulty ; ; END
there was no martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` god '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the UNK of the only world he had known during UNK then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by jubal , by UNK , by digby . END
`` thou art god '' . END
he was closer to understanding it in english now , although it could never have the UNK of the martian concept it stood for . END
in his mind he spoke simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking . END
repeating it like a student telling himself that the UNK is in the UNK he sank into UNK . END
before midnight he UNK his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , UNK and sat up . END
he had been weary ; ; END
now he felt light and gay and UNK , ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him . END
he felt a UNK need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . END
he stepped out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother . END
`` hi '' ! ! END
my , you look UNK '' . END
`` i feel fine ! ! END
where is everybody '' ? ? END
ben and UNK went home an hour ago and people started going to bed '' . END
mike felt disappointed that UNK had left ; ; END
he wanted to explain his new grokking . END
`` i ought to be asleep , too , but i felt like a snack . END
are you hungry '' ? ? END
`` sure , i'm hungry '' ! ! END
`` come on , there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else '' . END
they went downstairs , loaded a tray lavishly . END
`` let's take it outside . END
it's plenty warm '' . END
`` a fine idea '' , mike agreed . END
`` warm enough to swim -- real indian summer . END
i'll switch on the floods '' . END
`` don't bother '' , mike answered . END
`` i'll carry the tray '' . END
he could see in almost total darkness . END
jubal said that his UNK probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it ; ; END
his foster parents had taught him to see . END
as for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on mount UNK but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; ; END
he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it . END
but he was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking barefoot , rolling in it . END
in the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother . END
`` okay , take the tray . END
i'll switch on the underwater lights . END
that'll be plenty to eat by '' . END
mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ; END
it was a goodness , beauty . END
they UNK by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars . END
`` mike , there's mars . END
it is mars , isn't it ? ? END
or UNK '' ? ? END
`` it is mars '' . END
what are they doing on mars '' ? ? END
the question was too wide for the sparse english language . END
`` on the side toward the horizon -- the southern hemisphere -- it is spring ; ; END
plants are being taught to grow '' . END
`` ' taught to grow ' '' ? ? END
`` larry teaches plants to grow . END
i have helped him . END
but my people -- UNK , i mean ; ; END
i now grok you are my people -- teach plants another way . END
in the other hemisphere it is growing colder and UNK , those who stayed alive through the summer , are being brought into UNK for UNK and more growing '' . END
`` of the humans we left at the UNK , one has UNK and the others are sad '' . END
yes , i heard it in the news '' . END
mike had not heard it ; ; END
he had not known it until asked . END
`` they should not be sad . END
mr. UNK t. w. jones food technician first class is not sad ; ; END
the old ones have cherished him '' . END
`` you knew him '' ? ? END
he had his own face , dark and beautiful . END
but he was UNK '' . END
`` oh , dear ! ! END
mike do you ever get UNK ? ? END
for mars '' ? ? END
`` at first i was UNK '' , he answered . END
`` i was lonely always '' . END
he rolled toward her and took her in his arms . END
`` but now i am not lonely . END
i grok i shall never be lonely again '' . END
`` mike darling '' -- they kissed , and went on kissing . END
presently his water brother said UNK . END
`` oh , my ! ! END
that was almost worse than the first time '' . END
`` you are all right , my brother '' ? ? END
kiss me again '' . END
a long time later , by cosmic clock , she said , `` mike ? ? END
is that -- i mean , ' do you know ' '' -- END
it is for growing closer . END
now we grow closer '' . END
`` well i've been ready a long time -- goodness , we all have , but never mind , dear ; ; END
turn just a little . END
as they merged , grokking together , mike said softly and triumphantly : `` thou art god '' . END
her answer was not in words . END
then , as their grokking made them ever closer and mike felt himself almost ready to UNK her voice called him back : `` oh ! ! END
thou art god '' ! ! END
`` we grok god '' . END
on mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship . END
this went faster than scheduled as the UNK were helpful . END
part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a UNK plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations . END
the old ones neither helped nor UNK this plan ; ; END
time was not yet . END
their meditations were approaching a violent UNK that would shape martian art for many UNK . END
on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of UNK marks and spaces ; ; END
time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the federation assembly daily record should be translated into the medium . END
a UNK campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and mrs. joseph ( `` shadow of greatness '' ) douglas was quoted as saying : `` i would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without UNK '' . END
a UNK UNK from UNK , UNK , announced in beverly hills a newly discovered , ancient UNK discipline for ripple breathing which increased both UNK and cosmic attraction between sexes . END
his UNK were required to assume the UNK posture dressed in UNK UNK while he read aloud from UNK and an assistant UNK examined their UNK in another room -- nothing was stolen ; ; END
the purpose was less immediate . END
the president of the united states proclaimed the first sunday in november as `` national UNK day '' and urged america to say it with flowers . END
a funeral parlor chain was UNK for UNK . END
UNK bishops , after secret UNK , announced the church's second major miracle : supreme bishop digby had been translated bodily to heaven and UNK to UNK , ranking UNK UNK foster . END
the glorious news had been held up pending heavenly confirmation of the UNK of a new supreme bishop , UNK short -- a candidate accepted by the UNK faction after lots had been cast repeatedly . END
UNK and UNK published identical UNK of UNK UNK , UNK UNK and the christian science UNK ignored it , times of india UNK at it , and the manchester guardian simply reported it -- the UNK in england were few but extremely militant . END
digby was not pleased with his promotion . END
the man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished -- and that stupid UNK short was certain to UNK it up . END
foster listened with UNK patience until digby ran down , then said , `` listen , junior , you're an angel now -- so forget it . END
eternity is no time for UNK . END
you too were a stupid UNK until you poisoned me . END
afterwards you did well enough . END
now that short is supreme bishop he'll do all right , he can't help it . END
same as with the UNK . END
some of them were warts until they got promoted . END
check with one of them , go ahead -- there's no professional jealousy here '' . END
digby calmed down , but made one request . END
foster shook his UNK . END
`` you can't touch him . END
you shouldn't have tried to . END
oh , you can submit a UNK for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself . END
but , i'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the system yet . END
the UNK have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can't touch him . END
they run their show their way -- the universe has variety , something for everybody -- a fact you field workers often miss '' . END
`` you mean this UNK can brush me aside and i've got to hold still for it '' ? ? END
`` i held still for the same thing , didn't i ? ? END
i'm helping you now , am i not ? ? END
now look , there's work to be done and lots of it . END
the boss wants performance , not UNK . END
if you need a day off to calm down , duck over to the UNK paradise and take it . END
otherwise , straighten your UNK , square your wings , and dig in . END
the sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel UNK . END
get happy , junior '' ! ! END
digby heaved a deep UNK sigh . END
`` okay , i'm happy . END
where do i start '' ? ? END
jubal did not hear of UNK disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; ; END
if mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered . END
his household had gone through an upset . END
jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to inquire . END
mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the UNK . END
anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted . END
jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- UNK vs d , then UNK vs a or UNK vs cd , or ad vs UNK , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other . END
this continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before . END
jubal would not have UNK it if service had not gone to pieces . END
the girls seemed to spend half their time UNK in `` to see if mike was all right '' and they were too preoccupied to cook , much less be secretaries . END
even UNK anne -- hell , anne was the worst ! ! END
UNK , subject to unexplained tears jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the second coming , she would UNK date , time , UNK , events , and UNK pressure without batting her calm blue eyes . END
the expense and time involved are astronomical . END
however , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two . END
we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago ; ; END
that is all i can tell you about them . END
`` but the third ship came back several years ago and reported '' END
`` that it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by UNK beings '' ! ! END
said hal , forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak . END
macneff stopped pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes . END
`` how did you know '' ? ? END
`` forgive me , UNK '' , said hal . END
`` but it was inevitable ! ! END
did not the forerunner predict in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found ? ? END
i believe it was on page UNK '' ! ! END
macneff smiled and said , `` i am glad that your UNK lessons have left such an impression '' . END
how could they not ? ? END
besides , they were not the only impressions . END
i still bear scars on my back where UNK , my gapt , whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough . END
he was a good UNK , that UNK . END
as i grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where i was . END
he was my gapt in the UNK . END
he was the UNK gapt when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him . END
he is now my block gapt . END
he is the one responsible for my getting such low m. UNK . END
swiftly , came the revulsion , the protest . END
no , not he , for i , and i alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me . END
if i get a low m. r. , i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does . END
if i die , i die because i willed it so . END
so , forgive me , sigmen , for the UNK thoughts ! ! END
`` please pardon me again , UNK '' , said hal . END
`` but did the expedition find any records of the forerunner having been on this planet ? ? END
perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the forerunner himself '' ? ? END
`` no '' , said macneff . END
`` though that does not mean that there may not be such records there . END
the expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to earth . END
i can't tell you now the distance in UNK or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere . END
if you volunteer , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves . END
and it leaves very soon '' . END
`` you need a linguist '' ? ? END
`` the ship is huge '' , said macneff , `` but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one . END
we have considered several of your professionals because they were UNK and above suspicion . END
hal waited : macneff paced some more , frowning . END
then , he said , `` unfortunately , only one UNK linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition . END
`` a thousand UNK '' , said hal . END
`` but i have just thought of one thing . END
i am married '' . END
`` no problem at all '' , said macneff . END
`` there will be no women aboard the gabriel . END
and , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' . END
hal gasped , and he said , `` a divorce '' ? ? END
macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` you are UNK , of course . END
but , from our reading of the western talmud , we UNK believe that the forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce . END
it's inevitable in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years . END
naturally , he UNK the provision in obscure language . END
in his great and glorious wisdom , he knew that our enemies the UNK must not be able to read therein what we planned '' . END
`` i volunteer '' , said hal . END
`` tell me more , UNK '' . END
six months later , hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and watched the ball of earth UNK above him . END
it was night on this hemisphere , but the light UNK from the UNK of australia , japan , china , southeast asia , india , siberia . END
hal , the linguist , saw the glittering discs and UNK in terms of the languages spoken therein . END
australia , the UNK islands , japan , and northern china were inhabited by those members of the UNK union that spoke american . END
southern china , all of southeast asia , southern india and ceylon , these states of the UNK federation spoke bazaar . END
his mind turned the globe swiftly for him , and he UNK africa , which used UNK south of the UNK sea . END
all around the mediterranean sea , asia minor , northern india , and tibet , hebrew was the native tongue . END
in southern europe , between the israeli republics and the UNK peoples of northern europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called march . END
this was no man's land , UNK by the UNK union and the israeli republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years . END
neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic war . END
so , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( UNK outside its own borders ) . END
its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues , plus a new one called UNK , a UNK whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper . END
hal saw in his mind the rest of earth : iceland , UNK , the caribbean islands , and the eastern half of south america . END
here the peoples spoke the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the UNK who were busy UNK north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war . END
then there was north america , where american was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of UNK living on the hudson bay preserve . END
hal knew that when that side of earth rotated into the night zone , sigmen city would blaze out into space . END
and , somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment . END
but mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to UNK . END
she would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be UNK . END
her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought UNK . END
if hal yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . END
there was no such thing as an `` accident '' . END
somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . END
and , therefore , being in UNK , they would not be UNK and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . END
no , the fish could eat their bodies for all the UNK cared . END
hal felt sorry for mary ; ; END
he had a time keeping the tears from UNK to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . END
yet , he told himself , this was the best way . END
he and mary would no longer have to tear and UNK at each other ; ; END
their mutual UNK would be over . END
mary was free to marry again , not knowing that the UNK had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage . END
she would have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt . END
perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from UNK UNK child would no longer be present . END
hal doubted if this happy event would occur . END
mary was as frozen below the UNK as he . END
no matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt END
he would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice END
`` hal yarrow '' ! ! END
said the whining voice . END
and , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , hal turned . END
there was the squat UNK man , smiling UNK up at him . END
`` my beloved ward , my perennial UNK '' , said the whining voice . END
`` i had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage . END
but i might have known ! ! END
we seem to be bound by love ; ; END
sigmen himself must have foreseen it . END
love to you , my ward '' . END
`` sigmen love you , too , my guardian '' , said hal , choking . END
`` how wonderful to see your cherished self . END
i had thought we would never again speak to each other '' . END
the gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under UNK acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , UNK percent of the speed of light . END
meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the UNK . END
here they would lie in suspended UNK for many years . END
some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others . END
they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the UNK bodies of the personnel could not have endured . END
upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would UNK towards the star which was its UNK end . END
many years later , the UNK apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to UNK UNK . END
again , a force too strong for UNK bodies to endure would be applied . END
then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a UNK UNK . END
and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended UNK . END
these members would then UNK the rest of the personnel . END
and , in the UNK left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed . END
hal yarrow was among the last to go into the UNK and among the first to come out . END
he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen , siddo . END
and , from the first , he faced a difficult task . END
the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in UNK two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words . END
the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted . END
and , as hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases . END
this discovery caused hal anxiety . END
his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen . END
yet , if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be UNK his students UNK . END
moreover , even getting this across would be difficult . END
for one thing , the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed somewhat from UNK ; ; END
the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , UNK . END
it was true that they could be approximated , but would the UNK understand these UNK ? ? END
another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo . END
consider the tense system . END
instead of UNK a verb or using an UNK particle to indicate the past or future , siddo used an entirely different word . END
thus , the masculine UNK UNK UNK , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , UNK , and , in the future , UNK . END
the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other UNK . END
plus the fact that siddo not only had the normal ( to earthmen ) three UNK of masculine , feminine , and UNK , but the two extra of UNK and spiritual . END
fortunately , UNK was UNK , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo . END
the system of indicating UNK varied according to tense . END
all the other parts of speech : UNK , pronouns , adjectives , UNK , and UNK operated under the same system as the verbs . END
this was not , for the angel , just a matter of running through a logical or UNK chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise . END
no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer . END
what gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic assumptions , make UNK on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives . END
this is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an angel it takes time . END
( or , perhaps , especially in an angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago . END
being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to jack . END
he had already become used to UNK snapping back answers to questions almost before jack could get them asked . END
there was nothing he could do but wait . END
the dice were cast . END
at last gabriel spoke . END
`` we UNK you '' , he said slowly . END
`` we had concluded that no race as UNK as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice . END
of course we have before us the example of the great races at the UNK center ; ; END
individually they are nearly as mortal as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists . END
but they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young . END
we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half . END
`` for now , it is clear that we were in the wrong . END
you may UNK your property , and the penalty on hesperus is lifted . END
hesperus , you may speak '' . END
`` i did not perceive this essential distinction either , UNK '' , hesperus said at once , `` i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me , called a deal '' . END
`` nevertheless , you were its agent . END
jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ? END
`` it's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , jack said . END
`` we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' . END
his heart , he discovered , was pounding . END
`` for instance , hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and i agreed to take him to earth . END
between individuals , this process is called bargaining . END
when it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty . END
and the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine . END
recovering the property was much less important '' . END
`` strange '' , gabriel said . END
`` and apparently impossible . END
though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us '' . END
`` hesperus and UNK '' , jack said , `` show that we do '' . END
but this one was not nearly as long . END
`` then it is a matter of pleasure ; ; END
of a more alive time . END
yes , those could be commodities under this concept . END
but you should understand , jack , that hesperus and UNK are not long out of the nursery . END
visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older '' . END
this explained a great deal . END
`` all the more reason , then '' , jack said , `` why we must have a treaty . END
we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters , in return for their help in running our fusion reactors . END
but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands , to our hurt '' . END
`` but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in turn . END
to this we of course agree '' . END
jack felt a wave of complete UNK , but in a second it had vanished without a trace . END
what gabriel was asking was that mankind UNK all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws . END
the angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the earthmen -- but they had no UNK notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and UNK of his nature . END
the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to UNK , in short , was nothing less than total trust . END
nothing less would serve . END
and it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of UNK , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war . END
furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be UNK . END
almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and UNK attitude toward all outsiders . END
yet there was some precedent for it . END
the history of disarmament agreements , for instance , had been UNK dismal ; ; END
but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban , and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question . END
out of that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world UNK of the united nations ; ; END
suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of UNK as the twentieth-century rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies . END
besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be UNK out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history . END
the trouble with them was that they almost never worked , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled . END
suppose that this one were to work ? ? END
there was no question in jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least . END
if mankind could be convinced of that END
it was worth trying . END
in fact , it had to be tried . END
it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed . END
secretary hart had taught jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters ; ; END
but there was no small way to handle this one . END
he turned back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips . END
but he was too late . END
he had lost his audience . END
for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw . END
it seemed to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity . END
gradually , he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up . END
the angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random . END
what's going on here ? ? END
what's happened '' ? ? END
`` your brothers have been found . END
they are on their way here '' . END
i don't see them . END
the instruments don't show them '' . END
`` you can't see them yet , jack . END
they'll be in range in a short while '' . END
jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again . END
no -- there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ; END
and it was getting bigger rapidly . END
if that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed . END
then the skiff UNK into sight , just a dot of light at first against the UNK blackness and crimson streaks of the coal sack . END
through the telescope , jack could see that both UNK were still attached to it . END
the sail was still UNK , though there were a good many holes in it , as UNK had predicted would be the case by now . END
it was a startling , almost UNK sight ; ; END
but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous UNK of angels . END
the skiff was not heading for the nursery , however . END
it seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the UNK , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a UNK . END
and there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the UNK generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone . END
UNK , helpless , he watched them pass him . END
the sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars . END
he would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast . END
but where was it going ? ? END
and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels , and being followed by so many of them ? ? END
there was only one possible answer , but jack's UNK mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the UNK course into the computer . END
the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however . END
the skiff was headed for the very center of the UNK -- toward that place which , jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the UNK life and religion . END
it was clear that UNK had at last found a way to attract the UNK attention . END
it was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off . END
UNK would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not . END
almost surely he did ; ; END
after all , he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from , and he was an almost UNK UNK man . END
but not having talked to the angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line . END
had he decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith '' ? ? END
but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy of UNK , or was simply headed in that direction by accident . END
if it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ; END
and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous . END
jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had UNK from the UNK generator switch . END
when he was back on his feet again and about to UNK the UNK , however , he hesitated . END
he had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast . END
but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an angel aboard . END
`` hesperus '' ? ? END
`` i'm going to turn my generator back on , as i promised to do . END
but i can't take you to earth yet . END
first i've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble . END
will you obstruct this , or will you help ? ? END
i know it's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it '' . END
`` nobody else can live in your hearth while i am in it '' , hesperus said promptly . END
`` as for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong . END
if because of this incident they become angry with earth , i will not be permitted to go there at all . END
therefore of course i will help '' . END
with a UNK sigh of relief , jack UNK the UNK back in and threw the switch . END
without an UNK transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board . END
always before , it had taken five minutes to -- END
hesperus was in there . END
from here on out , the UNK was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of . END
but since he had failed to anticipate it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in UNK an intercept orbit . END
`` hesperus , don't use this UNK vector trick of yours , please . END
ryan UNK his bulk up and supported it on one elbow . END
he rubbed his eyes UNK with one huge UNK . END
`` ekstrohm , nogol , you guys okay '' ? ? END
`` nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured '' , nogol said . END
he didn't say what would cure him ; ; END
he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself . END
his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face . END
`` ekstrohm '' ? ? END
`` well , let's take a UNK look at the country around here '' . END
the UNK rolled open on the landscape . END
a range of bluffs UNK the horizon , the color of decaying moss . END
above them , the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis , seen against UNK snow . END
that cold , empty sky was full of fire and light . END
it seemed almost a magnification of the UNK itself , of the UNK way , blown up by some master photographer . END
this fiery UNK was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the UNK belt in the original solar system . END
these planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere . END
but to the UNK of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did . END
this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the UNK of UNK in three generations . END
they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of UNK in ancient history . END
`` how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? ? END
he was the captain , so he could ask questions like that . END
`` some can be lonely in a crowd '' , nogol said elaborately . END
`` what will we need outside , ryan '' ? ? END
`` no UNK '' , the captain answered . END
`` we can breathe out there , all right . END
it just won't be easy . END
this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago . END
nitrogen and oxygen are about it '' . END
`` ryan , look over there '' , nogol said . END
think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ? END
`` i think they're dead '' , ekstrohm UNK quietly . END
`` i get no readings from them at all . END
UNK , electronic , UNK -- all blank . END
according to these needles , they're stone dead '' . END
`` ekstrohm , you and i will have a look '' , ryan said . END
`` you hold down the fort , nogol . END
take it easy '' . END
`` easy '' , nogol confirmed . END
`` i heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an UNK reading on him . END
me , i know the mind of an officer works in a strange and UNK manner '' . END
`` i'm not worried about you UNK the UNK , nogol , just about a UNK like you reading them at all . END
remember , when the little hand is straight up that's negative . END
positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' . END
`` but i'm UNK '' . END
ryan told him what he could do then . END
ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the UNK with only a glance at the UNK gauge on his UNK . END
the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects . END
actually , the types of infection that could attack a UNK UNK were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories . END
he wasn't likely to come down with hot UNK and puzzling striped fever . END
they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the UNK gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground . END
it was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow . END
they walked from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side . END
ekstrohm UNK it with a boot . END
`` hey , this is pretty close to a UNK '' . END
`` UNK '' , ryan admitted . END
`` one of the best matches i've ever found . END
well , it has to happen . END
statistical average and all . END
still , it sometimes gives you a UNK feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world . END
it makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started '' . END
the surveyor looked sidewise at the captain . END
the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts . END
ekstrohm cleared his throat . END
`` what shall we do with this one ? ? END
UNK it '' ? ? END
ryan UNK it with his toe , following UNK example . END
`` i don't know , stormy . END
it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me . END
no hands , for one thing . END
of course , that's not definite proof '' . END
`` no , it isn't '' , ekstrohm said . END
`` i think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the UNK setup around here . END
in the meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead UNK represent . END
what killed them '' ? ? END
`` it looks like we did , when we made UNK '' . END
`` but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures '' ? ? END
`` radiation '' ? ? END
`` the planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output . END
any little dose of radiation might knock off these UNK '' . END
`` i don't know about that . END
maybe it would work the other way . END
maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any r's stored up , they could take a lot without harm '' . END
`` then maybe it was the UNK we set up . END
or maybe it's sheer UNK . END
they UNK up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a UNK '' . END
`` maybe '' , the captain admitted . END
`` at this stage of the game anything could be possible . END
but there's one possibility i particularly don't like '' . END
`` and that is '' ? ? END
`` suppose it was not us that killed these UNK . END
suppose it is something right on the planet , native to it . END
i just hope it doesn't work on earthmen too . END
these UNK went real sudden '' . END
ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet . END
the earthmen made camp outside the UNK . END
there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out . END
the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , UNK with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being . END
each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced UNK on board the ship . END
ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on UNK UNK . END
there was a UNK of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground . END
insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun . END
the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration UNK on board . END
yet he knew the others were sleeping more UNK , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had UNK them to send them riding high vacuum . END
ekstrohm was not asleep . END
now there could be an end to pretending . END
he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor . END
there was no longer any need to hide . END
but what was there to do ? ? END
what had changed for him ? ? END
he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep . END
in privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read . END
it was small comfort for UNK . END
some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this . END
actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and UNK that he forgot . END
others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept . END
his body processes only slowed down enough for him to UNK fatigue UNK . END
occasionally he fell into a waking , UNK stupor ; ; END
but he never slept . END
naturally , he couldn't let his UNK know this . END
UNK would ground him from the exploration service , on physiological if not psychological grounds . END
he had to hide it . END
over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could UNK . END
the buddies invariably took advantage of him . END
since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports . END
where the hell did he get off threatening to report any UNK on their part to the captain ? ? END
a man with UNK had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him . END
ekstrohm had to hide his secret . END
in a camp , instead of UNK , hiding the secret was easier . END
but the secret itself was just as hard . END
ekstrohm picked up a lightweight UNK from the ship's library , a book by UNK , the famous twentieth century expert on sex . END
he scanned a few lines on the social UNK of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty , UNK , UNK style . END
on impulse , he UNK up the heat control on his UNK and slid back the hatch of the bubble . END
ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen UNK of the thin air . END
behind him , his mates stirred without waking . END
ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble . END
it took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , UNK . END
the angry UNK face of ryan greeted him . END
`` okay , stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games . END
what did you do with them '' ? ? END
`` do with what '' ? ? END
`` the dead UNK . END
all the dead animals laying around the ship '' . END
`` what are you talking about , ryan ? ? END
what do you think i did with them '' ? ? END
`` i don't know . END
all i know is that they are gone '' . END
`` gone '' ? ? END
ekstrohm UNK his way outside and scanned the UNK . END
there was no ring of animal corpses . END
nothing but UNK grass whipping in the keen breeze . END
`` i'll be damned '' , ekstrohm said . END
`` you are right now , buddy . END
UNK doesn't like anybody UNK up primary evidence '' . END
`` where do you get off , ryan '' ? ? END
`` why pick me for your UNK ? ? END
this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon . END
why accuse a UNK of being behind this '' ? ? END
`` listen , ekstrohm , i want to give you the benefit of every doubt . END
but you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know . END
you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' . END
`` no '' , ekstrohm said , `` no , i didn't know that '' . END
`` you've been hiding things from me and nogol every jump we've made with you . END
now comes this ! ! END
it fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in '' . END
`` what could i do with your lousy dead bodies ? ? END
what would i want with them '' ? ? END
`` all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only UNK being who came in or out of our alarm web . END
the tapes show that . END
now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' . END
it was not a new experience to ekstrohm . END
suspicion wasn't new to him at all . END
`` ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies . END
look for them , will you ? ? END
i give you my word i'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition . END
take my word , can't you '' ? ? END
ryan shook his head . END
`` i don't think i can . END
there's still such a thing as mental illness . END
you may not be responsible '' . END
`` don't try anything violent , stormy . END
i UNK you fifty pounds and i'm fast for a big man '' . END
`` i wasn't planning on jumping you . END
why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ? END
she lived and was given a name . END
for her first three vegetable months she waved her UNK UNK , kicked UNK with her UNK feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant . END
she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery . END
soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began . END
one of the babies died in the initial UNK but of helva's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells . END
instead of kicking feet , helva's UNK responses started her wheels ; ; END
instead of grabbing with hands , she UNK mechanical extensions . END
as she UNK , more and more UNK UNK would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship . END
for helva was destined to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , UNK with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half . END
she would be among the elite of her kind . END
her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high . END
as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no UNK from the pituitary UNK , helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being . END
however , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early i.q. tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn . END
they would have to UNK their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of UNK would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession . END
a ship run by a human brain could not run UNK or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships . END
brain ships were , of course , long past the experimental stages . END
most UNK survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells . END
and very , very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine . END
shell people resembled mature UNK in size whatever their UNK UNK were , but the UNK brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe . END
so , for happy years , helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as stall , UNK , studying her lessons in UNK , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental UNK , basic alien psychology , UNK , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et UNK that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen . END
not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , helva ingested the UNK of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her UNK fluid . END
she would one day be grateful to the patient UNK of the UNK instruction . END
helva's civilization was not without busy , UNK associations , exploring possible UNK to terrestrial as well as UNK citizens . END
one such group got all UNK over UNK `` children '' when helva was just turning fourteen . END
when they were forced to , central worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs . END
very few committees ever looked past the first few photos . END
most of their original objections about `` shells '' were UNK by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed . END
helva's class was doing fine arts , a selective subject in her crowded program . END
she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel . END
her subject was large -- a copy of the last supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw . END
she had UNK her sight to the proper degree . END
as she worked she UNK UNK , producing a curious sound . END
shell people used their own vocal UNK and UNK but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths . END
helva's hum then had a curious UNK , a warm , UNK quality even in its aimless chromatic UNK . END
`` why , what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors . END
helva `` looked '' up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a UNK pink surface . END
her hum became a UNK of surprise . END
she instinctively regulated her `` sight '' until the skin lost its UNK look and the UNK assumed normal proportions . END
`` yes , we have quite a few years of voice training , UNK '' , remarked helva calmly . END
`` vocal peculiarities often become UNK irritating during prolonged UNK distances and must be eliminated . END
i enjoyed my lessons '' . END
although this was the first time that helva had seen UNK people , she took this experience calmly . END
any other reaction would have been reported instantly . END
`` i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended . END
would you like to see my work '' ? ? END
helva asked , politely . END
she instinctively UNK away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further UNK . END
`` work '' ? ? END
`` i am currently UNK the last supper on the head of a screw '' . END
`` no , i say '' , the lady UNK . END
helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically . END
`` of course , some of my color values do not match the old master's and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy '' . END
the lady's eyes , UNK , UNK out . END
`` oh , i forget '' , and helva's voice was really UNK . END
if she could have blushed , she would have . END
`` you people don't have UNK vision '' . END
the UNK of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate . END
`` here , this will help '' , suggested helva , substituting a UNK device in one extension and holding it over the picture . END
in a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly UNK and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw . END
`` well '' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread '' . END
`` are you referring , sir '' , asked helva politely , `` to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? ? END
`` i had that in mind '' . END
`` if you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' . END
`` which you are UNK to compute '' ? ? END
`` of course '' . END
`` did they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady '' ? ? END
`` we are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect '' . END
the good man UNK UNK and decided the trip was worth his time . END
if the investigation committee spent months UNK the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school , they left helva with a UNK as well . END
`` singing '' as applicable to herself required research . END
she had , of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` UNK UNK UNK '' , `` UNK '' , `` oklahoma '' , `` UNK de UNK '' , the atomic age singers , eileen farrell , UNK UNK and UNK UNK , as well as the curious rhythmic UNK of the UNK , UNK visual UNK and the UNK UNK of the UNK . END
but `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome . END
shell people were UNK to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a UNK . END
balanced properly between optimism and UNK , the UNK attitude of the shell people led them to UNK themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations . END
therefore to helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . END
she would work out a method , UNK her limitations , whereby she could sing . END
she approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental . END
her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal . END
breath control and the proper UNK of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice . END
shell people did not , strictly speaking , breathe . END
for their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells . END
after experimentation , helva discovered that she could manipulate her UNK unit to sustain tone . END
by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the UNK UNK , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most UNK position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone . END
she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not UNK although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all UNK , merely unique . END
acquiring a UNK from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall . END
she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy . END
it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , UNK , soprano and UNK as she pleased . END
it was , to helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and UNK control required by the music attempted . END
if the authorities remarked on her curious UNK , they did so among themselves . END
shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained UNK in their technical work . END
on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , helva was UNK graduated and installed in her ship , the aj . END
her permanent UNK shell was UNK behind an even more UNK barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship . END
the UNK , UNK , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed . END
her UNK were UNK , connected or augmented and the final , UNK brain UNK were completed while helva remained UNK unaware of the proceedings . END
when she awoke , she was the ship . END
her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed . END
she could take care of herself and her UNK half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine . END
her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on UNK panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession . END
she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner . END
there were nine qualified UNK sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was UNK . END
there were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva had been of interest to several department heads in central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section . END
consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners . END
the ship always chose its own partner . END
had there been another `` brain '' ship at the base at the moment , helva would have been guided to make the first move . END
as it was , while central UNK among itself , robert UNK sneaked out of the UNK UNK , out to the field and over to helva's slim metal hull . END
`` hello , anyone at home '' ? ? END
`` of course '' , replied helva logically , UNK her outside UNK . END
`` are you my partner '' ? ? END
she asked hopefully , as she recognized the scout service uniform . END
`` all you have to do is ask '' , he UNK hopefully . END
`` no one has come . END
i thought perhaps there were no partners available and i've had no directives from central '' . END
even to herself helva sounded a little UNK but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field . END
always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score . END
the sudden UNK had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive . END
`` no directives from central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their UNK to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' . END
it would have killed you in the cabin . END
do you have anything for me '' ? ? END
mercer stammered , not knowing what b'dikkat meant , and the UNK man answered for him , `` i think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet '' . END
mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm . END
b'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer . END
he tried to run after b'dikkat , to UNK the lead UNK , to tell b'dikkat that he loved him . END
he stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt . END
the UNK girl lay near him . END
mercer spoke to her . END
`` isn't it wonderful ? ? END
you're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful . END
i'm so happy to be here '' . END
the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them . END
she radiated warmth and good fellowship . END
mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming . END
he struggled out of his clothes . END
it was foolish and UNK to wear clothing when none of these nice people did . END
the two women UNK and UNK at him . END
with one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the UNK of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it . END
with most of his mind he was happy . END
he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this . END
he tried to tell the lady da , but the words weren't quite straight . END
a painful UNK hit him in the abdomen . END
the drug went after the pain and swallowed it . END
it was like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better . END
the pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time . END
he forced himself to be deliberate . END
he UNK his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay UNK nude beside him in the desert , `` that was a good bite . END
maybe i will grow another head . END
that would make b'dikkat happy '' ! ! END
the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position . END
said she , `` i'm strong , too . END
remember , man , remember . END
people never live forever . END
we can die , too , we can die like real people . END
i do so believe in death '' ! ! END
mercer smiled at her through his happiness . END
`` of course you can . END
but isn't this nice '' END
with this he felt his lips UNK and his mind go slack . END
he was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything . END
in that beautiful place , among all those UNK and attractive people , he sat and smiled . END
b'dikkat was UNK his knives . END
mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him . END
he endured the UNK of the dromozoa without UNK or movement . END
the UNK of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing . END
he watched his own body with remote , casual interest . END
the lady da and the UNK woman stayed near him . END
after a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms . END
having arrived he blinked UNK and UNK at them , and UNK back into the UNK stupor from which he had emerged . END
mercer saw the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining . END
time had no meaning . END
the dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; ; END
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body . END
at last he noticed a return of the UNK of pain . END
the pains themselves had not changed ; ; END
he knew all the events which could take place on shayol . END
he remembered them well from his happy period . END
formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them . END
he tried to ask the lady da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again . END
she smiled at him with UNK , remote happiness ; ; END
apparently her many UNK , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body . END
she meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech . END
the half-man lay on the ground , arteries UNK UNK behind the UNK film which protected his abdominal cavity . END
mercer squeezed the man's shoulder . END
the half-man woke , recognized mercer and gave him a UNK sleepy grin . END
`` ' a good UNK to you , my boy . END
that's out of a play . END
did you ever see a play '' ? ? END
`` you mean a game with cards '' ? ? END
`` no '' , said the half-man , `` a sort of UNK with real people doing the figures '' . END
`` i never saw that '' , said mercer , `` but i '' -- END
`` but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' . END
`` yes '' , said mercer , a little ashamed of his UNK . END
`` soon '' , said the half-man . END
that's why i think of plays . END
we all know what is going to happen . END
we all know when it is going to happen . END
we all know what the UNK will do '' -- he UNK at the UNK in which the UNK men were UNK -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask . END
but we never know how long a scene is going to take '' . END
`` what's a ' scene ' '' ? ? END
`` is that the name for the needle '' ? ? END
the half-man laughed with something close to real humor . END
`` no , no , no . END
you've got the UNK on the brain . END
a scene is just a part of a play . END
i mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes . END
the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long . END
i'm inclined to think that they are about two UNK each '' . END
mercer did not know what an `` UNK '' was , since he had not been a UNK man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time . END
the half-man received a UNK UNK , turned red in the face , shouted UNK at mercer , `` take it out , you fool ! ! END
take it out of me '' ! ! END
when mercer looked on UNK , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself . END
mercer himself could not tell how long it was before b'dikkat came back . END
it might have been several days . END
it might have been several months . END
once again b'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ; END
once again they clustered like children . END
this time b'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercer's thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with UNK eyebrows over the resting eyes . END
mercer got the blissful needle . END
when b'dikkat cut the head from mercer's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the UNK which held the head to his own body . END
he saw the UNK UNK as the head was cut ; ; END
he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as b'dikkat UNK the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . END
the next time it was two legs growing from his chest . END
then there had been another head beside his own . END
or was that after the torso and legs , waist to UNK , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? ? END
he forgot the order . END
he did not count time . END
lady da smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place . END
she had lost the extra UNK . END
in between UNK , she was a pretty and UNK woman ; ; END
but the UNK thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` people never live forever '' . END
she found this immensely comforting , even though mercer did not make much sense out of it . END
thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived . END
sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones , resting in the everlasting sleep of their UNK brains , in a UNK to be added to other herds . END
the bodies in the truck UNK and UNK without human speech when the dromozoa struck them . END
finally , mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin . END
he had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it . END
only the memory of previous hurt , UNK and UNK made him sure that if he did not ask b'dikkat when he , mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it . END
fighting pleasure itself , he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there . END
b'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway . END
he spoke through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting to tell them . END
when he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol : END
`` standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes . END
good luck , fellow '' . END
the secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about b'dikkat . END
what persuaded the UNK to remain on shayol ? ? END
what kept him happy without super-condamine ? ? END
was b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little UNK UNK himself ? ? END
mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat . END
his own fate he accepted . END
he remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan . END
the dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it . END
he staggered back to the group . END
the lady da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her . END
there were UNK square miles of seating space around them , but he appreciated the UNK of her gesture none the less . END
the years , if they were years , went by . END
the land of shayol did not change . END
sometimes the UNK sound of UNK came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ; END
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain UNK . END
there was night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men . END
time stood still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so UNK with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning . END
`` people never live forever '' . END
her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe . END
they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all . END
there was no dream of escape for these people . END
though they saw the UNK chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond UNK cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh . END
far long ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter . END
his handwriting was on a rock . END
mercer read it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it . END
nor did they care . END
the letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home . END
they could still read the opening : `` once , i was like you , stepping out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in . END
once , like you , i had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands . END
the front part of my head was called a face , and i could talk with it . END
now i can only write , and that only when i get out of pain . END
dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner . END
he was well rid of her . END
he certainly didn't want a wife who was UNK as ann . END
if he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble . END
but all of this was UNK . END
sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann , and then could not get back to sleep . END
his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing . END
the easiest thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it . END
the best UNK for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work . END
he found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake . END
each day he found himself thinking less often of ann ; ; END
each day the hurt was a little UNK , a little less poignant . END
he had plenty of work to do . END
because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years . END
the grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here . END
he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the UNK in his meadows . END
he had no idea how much time budd would give him . END
in any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence . END
he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm . END
when , in late afternoon on the last day in june , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle . END
it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up . END
no one walked in this country , least of all ed dow or dutch UNK or any of the rest of the bar b crew . END
morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled . END
when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever . END
he cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his winchester , and started downstream . END
his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , UNK toward the house . END
now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet . END
reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his winchester in his hands . END
they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty . END
they were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door . END
she lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet . END
the boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring . END
morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one . END
he didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending . END
the boy licked his dry lips . END
he asked , `` could we have a drink '' ? ? END
morgan jerked his head toward the front door . END
`` in the kitchen '' , he said . END
leaning his winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl . END
there's water in the house '' . END
she didn't move or say anything . END
her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him . END
she had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked . END
her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry . END
her blond hair was UNK , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection . END
it must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding . END
he picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house . END
she was UNK light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious . END
any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled . END
no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him . END
besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him . END
he put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table . END
they looked a good deal alike , morgan thought . END
both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features . END
morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth . END
she drank UNK , and murmured , `` thank you '' , as he lowered her head . END
he stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition . END
he had seen a few UNK wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two . END
the girl dropped off to sleep . END
morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper UNK that he had placed on the stove . END
he brought his winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy . END
`` who are you and what happened to you '' ? ? END
`` i'm billy jones '' , the boy answered . END
`` that's my wife UNK . END
we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' . END
`` what are you doing here '' ? ? END
`` are we in wyoming '' ? ? END
`` about five miles north of the line '' . END
jones sighed as if relieved . END
`` we've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' . END
`` you mean you dragged your wife all over UNK UNK looking for work '' ? ? END
`` the town of UNK only about six miles from here . END
why didn't you go there '' ? ? END
`` we didn't want town work '' , jones said . END
`` this is a mighty empty country '' , morgan said . END
`` there's only one more ranch three miles north of here . END
you'd have UNK to death if you'd missed both places '' . END
`` then we're lucky we got here . END
could you give us a job , mr. '' END
he was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple . END
they might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house . END
he dismissed the possibility at once . END
the girl's thin face haunted him . END
it wasn't the face of a killer . END
he wasn't so sure about the boy . END
he hadn't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , UNK expression . END
there was more to this than jones had told him . END
they were running from something . END
he'd be an UNK to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either . END
`` i could use some help '' , morgan said finally , `` but i can't afford to pay you anything . END
i guess you'd better go on in the morning '' . END
`` we'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly . END
`` i've been UNK in a mine in the san juan , but i used to work on a ranch . END
UNK , she's cooked in a restaurant . END
we'll work hard , mr. morgan '' . END
`` i'll see '' , morgan said . END
`` right now you need a meal and a bath . END
your wife's in terrible shape '' . END
`` i know '' , jones said UNK . END
morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table . END
when the meal was ready , he told jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl . END
he said , `` i've got some supper ready '' . END
she rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair . END
`` i'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed . END
`` who are you ? ? END
how did we get here '' ? ? END
`` i'm dan morgan . END
this is the UNK aj . END
you fell down in front of the house , and i carried you in . END
i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' . END
she stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ; END
then she murmured : `` you're very kind , mr. morgan . END
do you take in all the strays who come by '' ? ? END
`` i don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said . END
`` think you can walk to the table '' ? ? END
`` of course '' . END
she got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell . END
he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen . END
she sat down at the table , shaking her head . END
`` i'm sorry , mr. morgan . END
i'm usually a very strong woman , but i'm awfully tired '' . END
`` and hungry '' , he said . END
it's not much of a meal , but it's what i eat '' . END
`` not much of a meal '' ? ? END
`` mr. morgan , it's the UNK food i ever saw '' . END
he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much . END
when they were finally satisfied , jones said , `` i think he's going to give us work '' . END
the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself . END
when he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on . END
she said , `` i guess the lord looks out for fools , UNK , and UNK '' . END
`` which are you '' ? ? END
`` we're not UNK '' , she said . END
`` that's all i'm sure of '' . END
she helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark . END
he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall . END
he said : `` you'll feel a lot better after you have a bath . END
your feet are in bad shape , mrs. jones . END
you'll have to go to town to see the doc '' . END
`` no , she'll be all right '' , jones said quickly . END
`` i mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' . END
`` we'll see '' , morgan said . END
`` could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ? END
`` my dress needs some work on it '' . END
he nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and UNK . END
he said : `` i'm going to bed '' . END
he nodded at the door in front of him . END
`` that's my spare bedroom . END
the bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' . END
`` you're awfully kind '' , the girl said . END
`` we'll pay you back if you'll let us . END
`` it's all right '' , he said . END
`` i get up early . END
you'd better sleep '' . END
jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him . END
he said : `` if it's all right with you , mr. morgan , i'll sleep out here on the couch . END
we haven't slept together since we started . END
i just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' END
he stopped , embarrassed , and morgan said , `` i understand that , but i don't UNK why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' . END
`` we got fired '' , jones said . END
`` we had to do something '' . END
they were a pair of lost , whipped kids , morgan thought as he went to bed . END
`` you can't stay here with me . END
it's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' . END
`` you can't make me go '' . END
gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock . END
he was thinking of UNK and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the UNK . END
it was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt . END
beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and UNK of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see . END
clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known . END
against that other man he could rally his anger ; ; END
against this bent man in the chair he was UNK . END
gavin's lips moved so that clayton had to stoop to catch the words . END
`` do you remember big charlie '' ? ? END
`` he stuck with me all these years . END
just a half-breed UNK , never said much , never meant UNK to me , but he stuck with me . END
he got into a fight with tom english , your brother's son . END
it was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- big charlie told me so . END
they killed big charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago . END
my men , they all left me . END
i didn't understand why , clay . END
they just all cleared out . END
i treated them fair '' END
he wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder . END
`` do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin '' ? ? END
`` you don't hate me any more '' ? ? END
clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` no '' . END
`` come here '' . END
the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton went forward to him . END
gavin slipped his arms around his chest and UNK him UNK . END
`` all my life '' , he said , `` i tried . END
i saw you UNK away -- but i tried . END
and you wanted no part of me when i had so much to give . END
now there's UNK left of me . END
UNK is gone , my men are gone , ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me . END
god in heaven , i can't refuse you now . END
that would mock me too much ! ! END
can't let you go way from me again '' he closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears . END
`` i'll go , clay '' . END
clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back . END
the eyes followed him UNK . END
there isn't much time . END
i'll saddle the horses and bring them round . END
he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air . END
gavin's UNK was in the barn and he tightened the UNK over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words . END
when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch . END
the UNK had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to UNK the UNK , shaking his head . END
clayton UNK the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck . END
the mare had backed away . END
`` you take it easy , boy '' , clayton whispered . END
`` she doesn't want you now . END
you take it easy , your time will come '' . END
gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure . END
he had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock UNK on the wood floor . END
clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps . END
`` clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ? END
`` to a ranch in the valley . END
there's someone there i have to see . END
we may take her with us -- to california . END
i don't know yet , it's crazy ; ; END
i have to think about it . END
but california is where we're goin '' . END
gavin began to nod . END
`` that's a new land . END
a man could make a mark there . END
two men , together like us , we could do UNK fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been . END
start out fresh , the two of us , like UNK had ever happened '' . END
`` yes , like a father and son '' . END
`` i made you what you are '' , gavin whispered . END
`` i made you so you could stand up . END
i made you a man '' . END
`` yes , gavin , you did '' . END
he approached the horse and laid a hand on the UNK quivering neck . END
`` help me up , clay . END
help me up , i feel kind of stiff '' . END
clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child . END
`` i hate to leave my garden '' , gavin said . END
`` they'll UNK it down . END
i loved my garden '' . END
`` it will grow again -- in california '' . END
`` i loved this valley '' , he whispered UNK . END
`` lived alone here for three years , before any man came . END
lived alone by the river . END
it was nice then , so peaceful and quiet . END
there was no one but me . END
i don't want to leave it '' . END
clayton swung into the saddle and UNK the UNK UNK . END
the two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness . END
they rode at a measured pace through the valley . END
dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest . END
the moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever UNK before . END
it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his UNK and UNK suddenly to the hoot of an UNK or the rustle of a blade of grass in the UNK wind -- a savage land , UNK and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men . END
in that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind . END
he saw them UNK , strewn in the UNK of the broken and the dying . END
in vain his mind groped to UNK the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life . END
the silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search . END
they passed UNK that were framed dark gray against the black hills . END
then at last the darkness began to dissolve . END
a bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky . END
the UNK light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first UNK the contours of trees and fences and UNK UNK UNK . END
they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though UNK eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the UNK shelter of the trees . END
the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence . END
the men in UNK were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy . END
but the liquor had flushed their courage . END
they greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose . END
lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire . END
he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked . END
that's what you wanted , isn't it ? ? END
clayton is with him , UNK him out of the valley . END
`` keep out of this '' , purvis snarled . END
`` he's not your brother , he's gavin's son . END
you see , he lied to us when he said he was UNK alone '' . END
joe purvis was thinking back many years . END
first he thought of the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being UNK at the far end of the valley . END
he remembered gavin's UNK , his own UNK feeling , his UNK . END
then he thought of a time when UNK horse had fallen UNK in the gap . END
his wife had said to him : `` nellie is in love with clayton roy . END
he wouldn't even dance with her at gavin's party . END
he treats her like she was dirt . END
and you stand by like a fool and let him do it '' END
he remembered UNK mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water . END
it was the night clayton had UNK them in the poker game . END
`` you're gavin's son '' , joe purvis had said . END
he turned to lester . END
`` you brought him back to this valley UNK he would help you find your boy . END
he meant to help gavin all the time . END
he made a fool of you , lester '' . END
he swung round to the other men -- `` we can catch him easy ! ! END
there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place . END
if we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back . END
there's only one way they can get out now and that's through the gap -- if we ride hard we can take them '' . END
UNK hand UNK to UNK shoulder . END
the boy jerked away . END
`` he killed tom -- do you understand that '' ? ? END
UNK turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the UNK warmth of the saloon into the cold of the UNK night . END
he fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light . END
purvis and UNK UNK were the last to leave . END
they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance . END
in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a UNK of sudden wind to leave the valley clear . END
the clouds parted and hard UNK of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow . END
when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line . END
the wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were UNK and their UNK UNK like stiff black UNK in the wind . END
the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavin's UNK . END
he looked over his shoulder at the thin UNK of UNK . END
they neither gained nor fell back . END
he rode low on the UNK neck . END
ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the gap , no more than a mile away . END
gavin's face was UNK with excitement . END
he did not look back ; ; END
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north . END
he knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him . END
now they were riding to kill him . END
and he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time . END
the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley . END
with every UNK stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again . END
the gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted jack english on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him . END
california is too far , he thought . END
he would never reach california . END
he was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of UNK that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life . END
the sentry was not dead . END
he was , in fact , showing signs of UNK . END
he had been carrying an UNK rifle and a UNK navy UNK pistol . END
a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard . END
he was partially uniformed in a cavalry UNK and hat . END
mike stripped these from him and UNK them . END
he and dean tied and UNK the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose . END
they dragged him inside the building . END
fiske joined them , UNK on his feet . END
julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him . END
`` you are hurt '' ! ! END
`` i never felt better in my life '' , fiske UNK . END
he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek . END
`` thank you , my dear '' , he said . END
`` you are very brave '' . END
`` we'll talk later . END
first , we've got to get out of here '' . END
`` we'll grab horses '' , dean said . END
`` the main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' . END
mike debated it , trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride . END
but it at least offered him a chance for living . END
he had none here . END
and , for the sake of julia and susan , it had to be tried . END
the guerrilla bivouac remained silent . END
light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground . END
someone evidently was on duty there . END
no doubt there would be men guarding the horses . END
about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best mike could make out in the moonlight . END
evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency . END
he handed the guard's rifle to fiske . END
`` dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said . END
`` we'll stampede the rest . END
you stay with the ladies . END
all of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' . END
he added , `` if this doesn't work out , the three of you UNK yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' . END
he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol . END
susan halted dean and kissed him . END
she clung to him , talking to him , and UNK at her eyes . END
he was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had . END
he felt UNK weary . END
dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms . END
he kissed her also , and with deep tenderness . END
she too began to weep . END
he released her and joined mike . END
`` all right '' , he said . END
mike only said , `` later '' . END
`` be careful , UNK '' ! ! END
`` the way you were careful '' ? ? END
`` running around in the moonlight almost naked and UNK a man with a rock '' ? ? END
he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her . END
he might say or do something foolish . END
something all of them would regret . END
he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way julia fortune had taken UNK affections from her . END
and using him , mike UNK , as a UNK to her pride . END
he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol . END
`` stay well back of me '' , he said . END
`` i'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending i'm one of the guerrillas . END
there's bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close '' . END
holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade . END
it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings . END
one wing stood open . END
mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses . END
they were UNK , army style , on stable lines . END
a voice spoke UNK . END
`` who's that '' ? ? END
just me '' , mike said . END
`` is that you , bill '' ? ? END
he located his man . END
the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight . END
mike kept walking and got within UNK reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his UNK UNK . END
mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol . END
but the luck that had been running their way left him . END
the guard instinctively UNK the blow with his rifle . END
he tried to UNK the rifle around to fire into mike's body . END
mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded . END
the bullet went wide . END
mike swung the pistol in a savage UNK . END
this time it connected solidly on the man's temple , UNK him . END
the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills . END
the startled horses began UNK on their UNK . END
dean came rushing up . END
`` are you hit '' ? ? END
`` no , but the UNK in the fire '' ! ! END
`` there's no chance now of all of us getting away . END
you'll have to try it alone '' . END
the UNK saddled horse stood UNK nearby , having been kept handy in case of need . END
mike took the bayonet from UNK hand and slashed the picket line . END
`` up you go '' ! ! END
`` ride '' ! ! END
dean resisted mike's attempt to push him toward the horse . END
`` why not you '' ? ? END
`` dammit '' ! ! END
`` you're lighter than me . END
it's our only chance now . END
try to find these UNK . END
the rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back . END
you're the one that's taking the big chance '' . END
dean still hesitated , but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand . END
`` no telling how good this horse is '' , mike UNK . END
`` favor him and save something in case you hit trouble . END
watch out for apaches when it comes daylight . END
you might need it . END
we'll still have the rifle , and i might be able to round up some more . END
i'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' . END
dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty UNK on the back . END
`` UNK '' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` i'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again '' . END
then he was on his way at a gallop . END
mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet . END
he lifted a screeching war UNK . END
that touched off a total stampede . END
he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there . END
these poured through the gate and joined the flight . END
the animals UNK away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges . END
the guerrillas were UNK from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure . END
`` apaches '' ! ! END
`` they're UNK the stock '' ! ! END
he UNK in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings . END
his shout had been taken up and repeated . END
the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses . END
all were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were UNK or hardly clad at all . END
UNK and calhoun came running from the post . END
they had pistols in their hands . END
they UNK questions that were not answered in the UNK . END
they followed the others toward the east gate . END
beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches . END
mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings . END
he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner . END
the area was deserted . END
a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade . END
mike crawled to the door and peered in . END
the orderly room seemed to be deserted . END
a lantern hung from a peg , giving light . END
UNK inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner . END
a brace of pistols , UNK on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition UNK . END
an ammunition case stood open , containing UNK which contained powder cartridges . END
mike seized a blanket from a UNK in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his UNK . END
UNK the load he peered from the door . END
his UNK of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas . END
he looked at the looming UNK of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration . END
he set his bundle down . END
UNK the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post . END
he picked up the powder UNK and ran out . END
bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the UNK upon it . END
he UNK the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon . END
he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house . END
powder flame gushed beneath the wagon . END
the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him . END
they realized the truth . END
bullets began to snap past him . END
one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack . END
its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again . END
a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety . END
another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down . END
guerrillas were racing toward him . END
susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them . END
the three of them UNK through the door into the interior and fell in a heap . END
susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door . END
she crouched aside as bullets beat at the UNK , chewing into the planks . END
some tore entirely through the UNK post oak . END
the iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the UNK . END
mike rolled to susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet . END
he UNK over her to shield her , for spent bullets were UNK against the rear walls . END
he peered from a UNK . END
guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house . END
mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered UNK and fired . END
he dropped a man with the first bullet . END
at the same moment wheeler fiske fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit . END
that halted the rush . END
the guerrillas scattered for cover . END
the wagons were burning UNK . END
the UNK had caught fire also . END
the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings . END
the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
`` there goes our UNK an' ammunition '' ! ! END
`` get a bucket line going '' ! ! END
the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring . END
but what few containers they found were inadequate . END
many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a UNK effort . END
both buildings were in flames . END
the heat drove the guerrillas back . END
the roof of the command post began to buckle . END
`` drag the wagons to the spring '' ! ! END
`` run 'em right into the spring ! ! END
one of the wagons erupted a massive UNK of flame . END
a sizable supply of powder had been touched off . END
the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings . END
the glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine mike's wound . END
the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , UNK an ugly UNK that was forming a pool of blood on the floor . END
but it had missed the bone and had passed on through . END
susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury . END
mike tested the leg and found that he was able to UNK around on it . END
`` so it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! ! END
now dammit , i don't want to go into any more explanations . END
keep this to yourself '' . END
reverend jason , looking worried , hurried toward us . END
`` anything wrong , UNK ? ? END
the men seem to think so '' . END
`` UNK found a large war party south of us . END
they'll probably attack at dawn '' , montero said . END
he brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp . END
using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` fort up ! ! END
there's a large war party on their way '' ! ! END
for a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb . END
then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal . END
they all flew into action . END
`` that was a terrible thing to do '' , i said to oso . END
the aricaras treated us like friends . END
and here all the time you knew the sioux would be using our rifles on them ! ! END
god , what a world you people live in '' . END
oso gave me an UNK look . END
`` old UNK got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly . END
`` what would you have done in montero's UNK ? ? END
let old knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? ? END
he shook his head . END
`` mr. manuel did that in the war . END
that's why the british never got the tribes to fight for the king . END
mr. manuel whispered in the ears of the sioux that the UNK were UNK to raid 'em for their horses . END
then he went on to the UNK and told them that the sioux was goin' to move up . END
he did that with all the nations . END
hell , they were UNK each other so hard they had no time for anyone else . END
the war department wrote mr. manuel a letter and said he was a hero . END
i saw that letter . END
he carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin '' . END
`` but that was war '' , i said . END
`` there's no war on now '' . END
`` you're wrong , UNK . END
in this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green . END
first it was the nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites . END
and it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land '' . END
i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight . END
`` that's why this company's important . END
once we get over the mountains others will come along . END
that's why the trust don't want us to make it . END
that bastard chambers ! ! END
-- old UNK not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! ! END
before we get through he'll have the UNK UNK for our hair and our goods . END
well , UNK ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up '' ! ! END
as i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , i grudgingly found myself agreeing with UNK logic , especially when i imagined what would have happened to UNK if old UNK large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company . END
for , unlike the sioux and the UNK , the aricaras are not great UNK , nor are they aggressive like the savage UNK . END
more of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains . END
still , i was disgusted with myself for agreeing with montero's methods . END
surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done . END
in the brief moment i had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses , i indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river . END
`` i think montero did right '' , amy said firmly . END
`` let the savages kill each other . END
what do we care '' ? ? END
reverend jason was UNK bitter . END
`` it was a terrible thing to do . END
but oso replied calmly , `` trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , UNK '' . END
gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads UNK together the hills and the sky . END
our camp was in the center of a wide valley . END
montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush . END
he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire . END
the pony herd was the one UNK in our defense ; ; END
the UNK undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible . END
wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors . END
the cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day . END
buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered . END
the worst part had been the waiting ; ; END
although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long UNK night , filled with the sounds of the UNK insects , seemed endless . END
UNK and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian UNK , the UNK of a restless pony made one's skin crawl . END
oso slept UNK , his rifle UNK in his arms ; ; END
i didn't catch a wink . END
every time i closed my eyes , i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife . END
it was a relief when they finally came . END
they poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their UNK and filling the morning with their UNK scalp cry . END
`` oso '' , montero called `` i'll get gray eyes '' . END
`` that'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle . END
`` hold your fire '' , montero was shouting . END
`` wait until my shot . END
i'll shoot the first man who doesn't '' . END
i could see them in my sights . END
they were about a mile off ; ; END
under me the ground UNK slightly . END
at first they were only feathers and dark UNK faces and bodies , UNK over their UNK heads . END
gradually they emerged as men . END
gray eyes was in the lead . END
his face was split by a UNK streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ; END
jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest . END
he was naked except for a UNK . END
next to him was a young boy i was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions . END
his mouth was open , his neck UNK with the strain of his UNK . END
i found his chest in my sights . END
it had a red circle . END
the circle came nearer and nearer . END
my god , how long is he going to wait , i thought . END
at first i thought he had missed . END
gray eyes remained erect . END
the feathered UNK was still above his head . END
as he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse . END
i squeezed the trigger . END
at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony . END
i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball . END
he started to run but UNK shot caught him on the wing . END
he jerked once in the grass and lay still . END
`` if you're goin' to kill 'em -- ! ! END
kill 'em '' ! ! END
what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides . END
the aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated . END
`` lead up ! ! END
they'll be back '' ! ! END
far up the valley i could see the UNK UNK and UNK . END
out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war UNK , UNK , blankets and wounded and dead horses . END
the morning air was filled with the UNK odor of UNK blood , the UNK UNK of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder . END
a horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy . END
a rifle cracked ; ; END
the square head fell over . END
one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek . END
his legs UNK furiously , his long black hair UNK out behind him . END
there was a ragged volley . END
he was dead before he hit the ground . END
`` for christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! ! END
`` wait for the charge ! ! END
the charge , i tell you '' ! ! END
the sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint . END
they grew louder as the indians charged again . END
i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their UNK cries . END
`` gray eyes is back , , montero said . END
the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat . END
i could see the blood running down his chest . END
he was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump . END
i forgot to aim . END
in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger . END
montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ; END
there was no doubt he was dying . END
again we waited for montero . END
this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire . END
the horses were only several lengths away when he fired . END
the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse . END
our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts . END
but a few reached our wall . END
i heard the UNK of an ax and a UNK face burst apart in a bloody spray . END
i saw little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian's face became shattered flesh and bone . END
a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight . END
oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck . END
other indians were running at the ponies , UNK and waving blankets . END
reverend jason got one , the UNK the others . END
i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the UNK body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position . END
the ponies were almost UNK . END
the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again . END
this time more of them UNK the barrier . END
a small indian dived at montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt . END
it sounded like a man kicking a UNK . END
above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to UNK the bales . END
although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me . END
i could smell UNK , grease , and oil . END
his eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in . END
coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil . END
now under me i could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint . END
the aricaras made one last desperate charge . END
it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , UNK and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their UNK by the relentless UNK , UNK of the cruelly efficient UNK . END
others , badly wounded , gripped hands in UNK , knees in UNK , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped UNK , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs . END
some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last UNK charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts . END
none of them reached our walls again . END
the few survivors grudgingly turned away . END
in the distance we could hear the drums and the UNK of the death song . END
she was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and UNK from her wrist . END
`` i saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger . END
`` you could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size . END
it wouldn't matter to a fool like you . END
it would to me '' . END
`` all right '' , wilson said quickly . END
`` the UNK too big . END
and i appreciate the advice '' . END
he was losing patience again . END
an hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company . END
she had helped him change his mind . END
`` i'm not UNK you '' , she said . END
`` i'm telling you . END
that UNK too big . END
let it burn down . END
and make sure it's out when you leave in the morning '' . END
he was taken UNK . END
it took him a long time to compose himself . END
`` there's some mistake '' , he said finally . END
`` you're right about the fire . END
it's bigger than it has to be , though i don't see where it's doing any harm . END
but you're wrong about the rest of it . END
i'm not leaving in the morning . END
why should i ? ? END
i own the place '' . END
she showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face . END
it didn't seem to tell her anything . END
she glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and UNK scattered over the ground , the two kids , the UNK bull that was chewing its UNK just within the far reaches of the UNK . END
she studied it for a long time . END
then she turned back to wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it . END
`` you own this place '' ? ? END
she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly . END
`` you bought it '' ? ? END
`` from a man in st. louis '' , wilson said . END
maybe you know him '' . END
`` i know him . END
my father ran him off here six years ago '' . END
wilson didn't say anything . END
he stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next . END
she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him . END
`` UNK didn't tell you that '' , she said . END
`` no '' , wilson said . END
`` but it's understandable . END
it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . END
and it doesn't make any difference . END
he sold me a clear title . END
i have it with me , right here . END
if you want to see '' -- END
`` never mind '' , she said UNK . END
`` it wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me . END
i meant what i said about that fire . END
be sure it's out when you leave . END
i'll let you go back to doing the dishes now '' . END
it was meant to insult him , and didn't quite succeed . END
he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now . END
`` i don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly . END
`` it doesn't hurt . END
it might hurt you , though . END
somebody might mistake you for a woman '' . END
he meant to say more , but he never got the chance . END
she brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back . END
she swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle . END
she came down against him , and he tried to break her fall . END
he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him . END
it made him a little sick , and he let go of her . END
he got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her . END
he wiped the blood from his cheek . END
`` i ought to '' -- he said . END
he was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps . END
`` that quirt -- i ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . END
if you were a man '' -- END
`` she isn't , mister '' . END
the voice came from behind him , and wilson turned . END
the fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees . END
but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and wilson had a good look at him . END
he was tall and UNK , a half-breed , wilson thought . END
and he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that UNK across his cheek . END
`` she's not a man , mister '' , he said . END
if you've got any ideas '' . END
he raised the winchester and pointed it at UNK chest . END
`` put the rifle down , joseph '' , the girl said . END
`` i thought i told you to stay home '' . END
the half-breed eased the winchester down and rested it across his lap . END
the scar looked pure white in the UNK ; ; END
his eyes were black and UNK , and UNK . END
`` you shouldn't be riding up here after dark , UNK '' , he said quietly . END
`` i can take care of this . END
it's no job for you '' . END
the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him . END
he took it without UNK . END
`` i said go home , joseph . END
you've got no business up here '' . END
the half-breed didn't answer this time . END
but the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry . END
it made wilson wonder . END
he watched the half-breed as he turned silently . END
they could hear the UNK feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out . END
wilson brushed the dust from his coat . END
`` who was that '' ? ? END
`` your personal guard ? ? END
you're pretty hard on him '' . END
`` he works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind . END
`` he's a friend . END
his name's joseph UNK . END
is there anything else you want to know '' ? ? END
`` not now '' , wilson said . END
`` i guess i'll find out soon enough . END
you've got blood on your cheek . END
it must have got there when you fell against me '' . END
she wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . END
`` i'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , wilson said . END
he saw her hand start to work down the leather UNK toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . END
`` oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . END
`` i've had enough of that . END
i've had enough of you . END
i don't know what goes on around here , and i don't care . END
i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and i don't care about that , either . END
you took me by surprise . END
but i'll know how to handle you next time '' . END
she brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker . END
he UNK her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding . END
she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle . END
her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . END
he had forgotten that she was so pretty . END
but her UNK was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , UNK , UNK . END
he had known women like that , one woman in particular . END
and one had been too many . END
he watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping . END
they weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending . END
he hadn't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be UNK by a woman . END
they expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed . END
and determined not to show it . END
they lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed . END
`` go to sleep '' , he said . END
`` both of you . END
there's better things to do than listen to something like that . END
i'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' . END
he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream . END
the UNK was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it . END
not tonight , at any rate . END
he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble . END
if she did , he could stand it better in the light . END
he UNK UNK at the UNK and reflected on how things had turned out . END
that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the UNK ranch house , his hopes had been high . END
already some of the pain had gone from UNK death . END
not all of it . END
there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief . END
but they were starting a new life . END
and they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two UNK UNK , three horses . END
the land wasn't all wilson had expected of it . END
six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in st. louis had said ; ; END
good grass , good water . END
well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it . END
the water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead UNK . END
and there was a house ; ; END
UNK perhaps , but badly in need of repairs . END
in the last analysis , though , wilson had little cause to complain . END
the place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after UNK burial -- and it would serve its purpose . END
there was only one place where jake UNK description had gone badly UNK : the peace and quiet . END
it hadn't started out that way . END
and he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better . END
they had the house cleaned up by noon , and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses . END
he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him . END
kathy was already in the wagon . END
they were going to town , and they were both excited . END
wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they weren't going to town at all . END
he had an uneasy feeling about it . END
that girl last night , what was her name ? ? END
it was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember . END
he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him . END
he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than UNK pierce had made it seem . END
there was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to UNK . END
but there was water . END
there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside UNK . END
yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble . END
there were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres . END
the first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley . END
it was hotter once they reached the flat , and UNK , but the grass was better . END
a warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves . END
a UNK hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road . END
it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of UNK . END
the town was about what wilson expected : one main street with its rows of UNK buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; ; END
all dusty and UNK . END
the place was quiet . END
such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this ; ; END
under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all . END
i was nearly thirty at the time . END
i went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters . END
it was dark and , i sensed , very large ; ; END
only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it . END
sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness . END
i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded . END
a glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most . END
drifting here and there . END
squatting , as if waiting . END
the UNK glow of a cigarette . END
since they could see me but i not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me . END
the clerk paid them no attention . END
this impressed me , until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence . END
his job simply consisted in registering new men . END
when the phone rang he answered it . END
his authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further . END
none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him . END
UNK was attacking his UNK . END
he spoke to me in a gruff voice , an UNK which quite UNK his personality . END
he wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath . END
it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was . END
but it was not easy for him and he often slipped . END
when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the UNK of UNK i noticed how the clerk UNK . END
i felt certain he was really a UNK little man . END
his hat ( the cause of his UNK ? ? END
) hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it i could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of UNK respectability that ought never to have left his neck . END
the UNK UNK were on the counter , and a stack of UNK men's magazines . END
on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio UNK permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music . END
everything about the clerk was trivial . END
once , pressing him , i learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall . END
noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what UNK and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person . END
with distaste i saw him assume a UNK air . END
when he saw me coming he turned his radio off . END
he made a show of UNK my forms on the shelf . END
he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance . END
what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me . END
in the mornings , i was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall . END
they , and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office . END
he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i UNK believed that he would let deed follow words . END
i was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning . END
now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand . END
he couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said . END
each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient . END
i withdrew my hand . END
later i would remember what this UNK little man had told me about the worth of a ticket . END
having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself . END
when UNK lighted , what would it look like ? ? END
the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air . END
one afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall . END
by counting the number of UNK and UNK i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time . END
for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended . END
i could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison . END
i had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself . END
i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , i could not tell . END
it was , i felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners UNK removed from the counter with its overhead light . END
this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were UNK rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below . END
also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder . END
no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention . END
and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the UNK occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently . END
this sort of petty vigilance annoyed me . END
i felt certain it was UNK . END
it sprang from a type of UNK i'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here . END
i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed . END
i felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance . END
i lived in a state of suspense because of it . END
i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to . END
i had signed it off on the forms . END
my future lay solely with the hall , yet what did i know about the hall at this point ? ? END
although i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning . END
i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing . END
i did not despair , however ; ; END
far from it ! ! END
i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall . END
though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me . END
large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall UNK . END
the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it . END
sometimes i noticed the tops of UNK UNK and UNK reaching above the UNK roofs . END
the sounds issuing from beyond -- UNK UNK , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me . END
the hall , on the other hand , appeared UNK and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons . END
it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before . END
its front was UNK , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street . END
i kept UNK the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall . END
but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it . END
for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and UNK lunch counters , yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there . END
i returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk . END
as i had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application . END
meanwhile spring had passed well into summer . END
at last , when i put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual . END
when i asked him what , if anything , i could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall . END
i could consult this UNK on any UNK morning , though not before ten o'clock . END
the clerk impressed this upon me : that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock . END
when i went for my interview with the director i saw why . END
although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people . END
cigarette butts littered the floor . END
the big fans were going , drawing from the large room the UNK of stale smoke which drifted about in pale UNK underneath the ceiling . END
i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs . END
the staircase itself seemed still to be UNK the heavy UNK of many men . END
i stopped by the counter . END
no one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office i noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open . END
past it i could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor . END
i rapped my knuckles on the counter . END
the director came to the door . END
i was at once disappointed , although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained . END
he was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ; END
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and UNK soft collar . END
he wore UNK , UNK shoes ; ; END
they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville UNK routine any moment . END
but he came toward me UNK enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application . END
i had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times . END
he did not look at them now . END
as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall . END
he spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance . END
why had i registered ? ? END
begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall . END
he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; END
indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them . END
was i sure , he asked , that i knew what i was applying for ? ? END
what sort of men i would come into contact with , at the hall ? ? END
these questions did not surprise me ; ; END
i felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place . END
though i doubted that he would understand me , i told the director my motives for applying . END
i had always , i said , UNK after working hard with my hands . END
this desire , i went on , growing UNK as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual UNK . END
to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence . END
the flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head . END
`` tie him up '' . END
`` hell with it '' . END
before they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard . END
the man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor . END
barton said harshly , `` why did you do that '' ? ? END
rankin UNK at him . END
`` what did you want me to do , kiss him ? ? END
he dumped me in solitary twice '' . END
barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around . END
`` let's get one thing straight , you and me . END
the only reason we brought you was to get miller out . END
if you ever try anything without my orders i'll kill you '' . END
fred rankin looked at him . END
it seemed to barton that the green eyes UNK him , the UNK smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now . END
they filed out through the UNK door , into the paved square . END
there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks . END
there was no chance . END
they moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall . END
there was no moon . END
they had chosen this night purposely . END
they reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and powers slipped through the door . END
two men were on duty inside , playing UNK , relaxed . END
they looked up in surprise as powers came in . END
`` what are you doing out of the block '' ? ? END
`` it's UNK '' , he said , naming the man rankin had hit . END
`` i've got to have help '' . END
they stared at him . END
the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet . END
`` what's wrong with him '' ? ? END
`` he's having some kind of a fit '' . END
the sergeant turned to the door . END
as he passed through it barton shoved his gun against the man's side . END
`` one sound and you're dead '' . END
powers had not followed . END
powers was covering the remaining guard . END
the man UNK for the cord of the alarm bell . END
powers knocked his arm aside . END
deliberately , with none of UNK UNK , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head . END
even barton could not quite believe it . END
it had gone without a hitch . END
they slid through the UNK in the big gate , UNK across the dark ground . END
five minutes later they reached the horses . END
barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts . END
he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the escape party they would be short . END
they walked the horses , heading along the river , barton and emmett foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night . END
the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts . END
in a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees . END
foster had brought extra clothing also . END
a good man , emmett . END
he had been one of the original night riders , one who had escaped the trial . END
it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on UNK release from the prison . END
UNK miller was crying softly to himself , UNK his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript UNK pants , the worn brown shirt . END
kid boyd was unusually silent , rankin UNK , a few paces apart . END
barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers . END
`` i won't even try to thank you '' . END
the UNK guard was embarrassed . END
he said in a studied voice , `` i didn't do it for you . END
i did it for the valley . END
you're the only man the night riders will follow . END
we've been starving and i don't like to UNK '' . END
barton turned away , his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse . END
`` good luck '' . END
the murderer lifted his head . END
`` meaning you want me to ride out '' ? ? END
`` you aren't one of us . END
there's nothing for you here '' . END
`` i got no place to go '' . END
he did not trust rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct . END
but ten years in prison had taught him realities . END
they were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money . END
it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them night riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure . END
but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the UNK on the other side . END
`` your choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to kid boyd . END
`` bury those uniforms so they won't be found '' . END
then barton touched carl UNK arm and moved off , up the river bank . END
he wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley . END
they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently . END
he too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco . END
mitchell barton drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he UNK . END
through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly . END
for his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell . END
carl dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man . END
he had been the UNK for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the UNK money . END
he had done time for the theft . END
the one thing they had in common was their hatred . END
both hated donald kruger . END
it had drawn them together , and since his release from prison dill had worked UNK to effect this night's escape . END
he said now , `` i've got the perfect headquarters set up . END
the old UNK mine '' . END
UNK barton knew the place . END
twenty years before a group of UNK had bought out the UNK claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley . END
they had spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their UNK tunnel . END
then the vein had UNK out and the whole project had been abandoned . END
`` the road's washed badly '' , said dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse . END
a company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' . END
`` how do the valley people feel '' ? ? END
`` as mad as ever . END
but UNK men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me . END
when they learn you're in the hills though , they'll rally , don't worry about that '' . END
barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always UNK in his mind . END
did you find him '' ? ? END
dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension . END
`` he's in morgan's ferry '' . END
barton UNK in surprise . END
`` what's he doing there '' ? ? END
`` dealing faro '' . END
`` dealing faro ? ? END
how come '' ? ? END
`` your UNK has the faro bank in cap UNK saloon '' . END
barton cursed under his breath . END
after another long pause he asked , `` how many people know who they are '' ? ? END
your cousin UNK saw to that . END
he's quite a rat , you know . END
he sold out to UNK men . END
he's informed them of everything you've ever written him . END
he wants your ranch '' . END
he said tensely , `` all right . END
let's go get the boy '' . END
dill had come up also . END
`` i was afraid of this . END
i almost didn't tell you '' . END
`` if you hadn't i'd have killed you '' . END
`` but you can't ride into the ferry . END
that's what they'll expect you to do . END
they'll be there waiting for you . END
i understand how you feel about the child . END
`` the hell you do '' . END
UNK voice was UNK than dill had ever heard it . END
`` i never saw him . END
my wife died in UNK after i was sent away . END
`` i can't leave him there . END
donald kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as UNK , and i wouldn't UNK a snake to his tender care . END
i've got to get the boy . END
UNK men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult . END
it was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state . END
it reached donald kruger in his massive home in UNK . END
it reached the mines at north san juan and UNK . END
it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences . END
for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder UNK , and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence . END
UNK hague sat in his office above the UNK pit . END
the office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove . END
the building was UNK by the scene outside . END
there a dozen giant UNK played their UNK jets of water against the huge seam of UNK gravel which was the mountainside . END
the gravel was the bed of an ancient river , UNK in some UNK UNK of earth . END
it was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire UNK , and with the gold it held washed down through the long UNK . END
a million UNK of gold a month . END
a million tons of rock and soil and brush . END
the UNK ran twenty-four hours each day . END
their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred UNK could be heard for miles . END
hague , like all who worked near the pits , was partly UNK from the constant assault against his UNK . END
he was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold UNK air . END
fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt . END
ten years older than UNK barton , he had UNK his way up from UNK in the pits to manager of the operation . END
he was proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted him . END
he lived and breathed for the mining company . END
no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and hague had made a virtue of UNK all of his life . END
there came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room . END
hague had never accustomed himself to kodyke . END
the man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a UNK nose . END
the eyes always held hague , eyes of a dead man , UNK as a UNK , with the fixed intensity of a UNK . END
even hague was repelled by the UNK UNK that was kodyke . END
he knew nothing about the man's history . END
kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger . END
kodyke was to head the dread company police . END
he ran the change rooms . END
he threw out the UNK . END
he supervised the UNK and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to san francisco . END
hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike . END
he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a UNK . END
`` this is mitchell barton . END
he broke out of UNK last night . END
apparently he UNK one of the guards . END
we want him back there or we want him dead '' . END
kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully . END
`` dangerous '' ? ? END
`` dangerous , yes . END
you know how the ranchers in the valley are . END
they blame us for all their troubles . END
ten years ago they blew up some of our UNK . END
it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them . END
we don't want UNK night riders loose again '' . END
the UNK nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing . END
normally hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew kodyke was aware of all he said . END
if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it . END
after they had finished eating , UNK took UNK the kitten under her arm -- `` so that UNK grace can teach it about the whistle '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother . END
she had offered to walk , but pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` UNK '' . END
when they reached their UNK house , pamela said a few polite words to grace and kissed UNK lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again . END
then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her UNK destination . END
as she drove , she thought about her plan . END
it was really quite simple . END
so simple , in fact , that it might even work -- although pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance . END
that mistake , she thought , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her . END
she must be cautious so as not to alert the UNK forest . END
when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the UNK house , pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped . END
all of her movements were careful and methodical , UNK of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his UNK for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime . END
she locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house . END
here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom . END
on her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded UNK -- an object which , pamela believed now , had been the property of her UNK , major UNK UNK UNK . END
he had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had UNK it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him . END
if she , pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of UNK . END
she would return this symbol to the mountain , as one UNK seed back into the soil every spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice . END
slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house . END
there was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , UNK pool UNK in its secret bosom . END
UNK , if UNK were possible , could only be made at that sacred , UNK basin . END
it was there that she would have to enact her UNK , beg forgiveness . END
perhaps it was insane , pamela thought . END
perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream . END
but she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken . END
facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool . END
she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it . END
the forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand . END
the ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle . END
birds UNK and UNK in the trees and the sun , all UNK and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time . END
it was not , thought pamela , such an evil place after all . END
no wonder UNK responded so completely to its UNK . END
perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed . END
was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the UNK that she had UNK in failing to understand this ? ? END
pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along . END
the slight UNK that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not UNK her fear . END
she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her UNK , undefined struggle with the mountain and its UNK inhabitants . END
having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them . END
a few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ; END
today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable . END
she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ; END
she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal . END
if , as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that UNK . END
if the slope grew UNK and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed . END
success depended upon maintaining her UNK ; ; END
she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest . END
the forest took on an impersonal aspect . END
it did not care what sort of person UNK its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the UNK from its bushes . END
unconcerned , indifferent , UNK , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's UNK with more abundant growth and man's UNK with its own musical evening laughter . END
red man or white man , UNK or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could UNK equally well on slaughter and UNK ; ; END
knowing that its UNK mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man . END
pamela shook her head . END
she must not think about time . END
that was another one of those traps . END
in her grim pursuit of UNK , pamela focused her thoughts on her husband . END
if , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand . END
how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent ? ? END
indian ghosts would not UNK upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the UNK , UNK figure of her UNK ancestor . END
his bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images ; ; END
they would not dare to face his UNK . END
pamela was glad jim was nowhere near . END
his presence would have interfered with her duty . END
the mountainside grew UNK and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles . END
the trees huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun . END
bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming UNK UNK for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , pamela could no longer be positive of her direction . END
nevertheless , she continued to move upward . END
she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles . END
the forest had become an alien world where she strove , alone , UNK , UNK , to deal with whatever UNK were offered . END
it was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , UNK the sun and human time . END
at one and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the UNK that would give her entry . END
silence came into the forest -- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees . END
silence walked at UNK side , its presence UNK close , yet too far for her to hear . END
silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , UNK her retreat . END
she stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded UNK above the earth . END
in spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , UNK her arm on a naked stone . END
for a moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened UNK , she lifted herself to her feet UNK . END
she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes . END
her arm UNK slightly , and the UNK skin cried out in pain . END
she seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had UNK been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees . END
she stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her . END
she was standing in a thick grove . END
the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches UNK , virtually UNK out the sun completely . END
the earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays . END
she had the feeling that , under the UNK leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain . END
the thought made pamela shudder . END
a terrible chill swept through the grove . END
not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching pamela in a leering embrace . END
there was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived . END
where before had she felt or UNK or imagined such a scene ? ? END
she already knew this UNK , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive . END
it enclosed her UNK hands and twined around her ankles . END
it crept into the open neck of her UNK and slid down her body , UNK into her flesh through all the quivering UNK of her skin . END
it crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her UNK . END
it circled her thighs , exploring with its icy UNK . END
it entered her body with the ghastly UNK of an UNK , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that UNK her knees so tightly that they UNK ; ; END
UNK her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps ; ; END
clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid UNK of her jaws . END
she had to get away from here before this UNK possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , UNK her of reason and sight . END
but she did not know which way to go . END
the shadows of the trees engulfed her , UNK every possible exit from the grove . END
she had been UNK here by a vile sensuality that UNK around her throat in UNK circles . END
she could not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her UNK mouth , who would hear , who would listen ? ? END
does the mountain listen ? ? END
she had to escape . END
she had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place . END
she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to UNK her back . END
her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon UNK still clung and caressed . END
every movement she made seemed UNK noisy . END
UNK cracked loudly under her feet ; ; END
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ; END
tree branches snapped as she pushed them UNK away from her . END
UNK , she found exactly the right statement . END
she began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . END
`` i want to tell you something thomas UNK lord . END
i'm well aware that you've got a UNK as long as my leg , and that i don't amount to anything . END
`` but it don't matter UNK '' , lord supplied fondly . END
`` to me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the UNK flower that grows '' . END
beaming UNK , he UNK out his lips and attempted to kiss her . END
she yanked away from him furiously . END
`` you shut up ! ! END
i've got something to say to you , and by god you're going to listen . END
do you hear me ? ? END
you're going to listen '' ! ! END
he said he wanted very much to listen . END
he knew that anything a UNK little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as UNK to the ear , and he didn't want to miss a word of it . END
so would she mind speaking a little louder ? ? END
`` i think you UNK , tom lord ! ! END
i think you're mean and UNK and stupid , and -- louder '' ? ? END
so i can hear you while i'm UNK the car . END
looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble '' . END
he opened the door and got out . END
he waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her UNK . END
wasn't you goin' to say UNK '' ? ? END
then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` maybe you could write it down for me , huh ? ? END
print it in real big letters , an' i can UNK it out later '' . END
`` UNK , go on '' , she said . END
`` just go the hell on '' . END
he grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car . END
lips UNK UNK , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side . END
then he UNK down on the heels of his UNK boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock UNK , and spring . END
he went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination . END
after a time , he straightened again , brushing the red UNK dust from his hands , slapping it from his UNK UNK and his tailored , UNK shirt . END
he wore no gun -- a strange UNK for a peace officer in this country . END
never , he'd once told joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun . END
and he really feels that way , she thought . END
that's really all he's got , all he is . END
just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost UNK package . END
if i could make myself feel the same way END
she studied him hopefully , UNK ; ; END
against the UNK background of sky and UNK it was easy to confirm her analysis . END
here in the UNK place , the westerly end of nowhere , tom lord looked almost insignificant , almost UNK . END
he was handsome , with his UNK hair and eyes , his UNK features . END
but she'd known plenty of UNK guys , and , UNK his good looks , what was there left ? ? END
he wasn't a big man ; ; END
rather on the medium side . END
neither was he very powerful of build . END
he could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong . END
and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance . END
just nothing , she told herself . END
just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone . END
but , by UNK , i want him and i'm going to have him ! ! END
he caught her eye , came back around the car with the UNK ; ; END
UNK , UNK walk . END
why did these UNK still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ? ? END
he slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely UNK one to her . END
`` oh , cut it out , tom '' ! ! END
`` can't you stop that stupid UNK for even a minute '' ? ? END
`` this ain't your brand , maybe '' , lord suggested . END
`` or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar '' ? ? END
`` i feel like getting back to town , that's what i feel like ! ! END
now , are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk '' ? ? END
`` might get there faster UNK '' , lord UNK , `` UNK as how i got a UNK front spring . END
on the other hand , UNK , maybe you wouldn't either . END
i UNK it's UNK a UNK walk , and i UNK maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours '' . END
`` how -- with what ? ? END
there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' . END
`` now , ain't it the truth '' ? ? END
lord laughed with secret amusement . END
`` not a UNK thing but rattlesnakes , so i reckon i'll get the boss UNK to help me '' . END
for god's sake '' ! ! END
he pointed , cutting her off . END
`` see that wildcat '' ? ? END
she saw it then , the distant UNK of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country . END
and even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; ; END
sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town . END
a UNK had to be prepared for almost any emergency . END
he had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others . END
`` well , let's get going '' , she said impatiently . END
`` i '' -- she broke off , frowning . END
`` what did you mean by that UNK gag ? ? END
getting the boss UNK to help you '' ? ? END
`` why , i meant what i said '' , lord declared . END
`` what else would i mean , UNK '' ? ? END
she looked at him , lips compressed . END
then , with a UNK of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up . END
in his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ; END
that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . END
otherwise , she would be UNK into a UNK -- UNK and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the UNK struggle of tom lord vs. joyce UNK . END
the car lurched along at a UNK crawl , the UNK UNK banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself . END
lord whistled UNK as he fought the steering wheel . END
he seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned . END
along with this self-satisfaction , however , joyce sensed a growing tension . END
it poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his UNK body were UNK for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated . END
joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion . END
that was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride , field boss for the highlands oil & gas company . END
tom had been laying for aaron mcbride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line . END
mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip . END
he had a legitimate reason for wearing it . END
it was UNK for highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields . END
moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it . END
`` so what's this all about '' ? ? END
he demanded , when lord confronted him . END
i'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit '' . END
it was the wrong thing to say . END
by failing to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into lord's hands . END
the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest . END
the deputy had forced him to by his manner of UNK him . END
so , `` how about it '' ? ? END
`` why single me out on this permit deal '' ? ? END
`` well , i'll tell you about that '' , lord told him . END
`` we aim UNK be UNK , UNK ? ? END
don't like to bother no one unless we have to , which i UNK we do , in your case . END
UNK we got to be plumb careful with any of you highlands big shots '' . END
he himself had heard that there was UNK money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him . END
he was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable . END
`` look , lord '' , he said hoarsely . END
`` i know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe i can't blame you . END
you think that highlands UNK you and i helped 'em do it . END
but you're all wrong , man ! ! END
i just do what i'm told , and '' -- END
an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's UNK for UNK . END
so you get rid of that pistol right now , UNK mcbride . END
you do that or take you out a permit right now '' . END
mcbride couldn't do either , of course . END
not immediately , as the deputy demanded . END
not without a face-saving UNK of at least a few minutes . END
to do so would make his job UNK impossible . END
UNK workers were a UNK lot . END
how could he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line , as he had to -- if he UNK under to this small-town UNK ? ? END
`` i'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately . END
`` just as soon as i go to the bank , and '' -- END
now , UNK mcbride '' , said lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field UNK arm . END
it was strictly the UNK game , but mcbride had gone too far to throw in . END
now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck . END
he flung off lord's hand and attempted to push past him , UNK shoving him into a UNK . END
it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own UNK . END
lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine . END
then , as he doubled , gasping , UNK the breakfast he had so lately eaten , lord straightened him with an UNK . END
a rabbit punch UNK him . END
and then there was a UNK blow to the heart , and another UNK blow to the stomach END
but he couldn't keep up with them . END
no more could he defend himself against them . END
he seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen . END
and he could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape . END
why , he's going to kill me , he thought wildly . END
i meant him no harm . END
i've given UNK hurt to no man . END
i was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me . END
beat me to death in front of a hundred people . END
somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go UNK . END
he , mcbride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , lord , would go UNK , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too UNK . END
mcbride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the UNK dust . END
UNK , fleeing the UNK shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again . END
he couldn't see ; ; END
he was long past the point of coherent thinking . END
dimly , he heard laughter , UNK of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . END
he could not grasp that lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his UNK arms were UNK at nothing but the air . END
he hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated UNK world that was lord's world . END
this , he was sure , was the way they would act ; ; END
laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death . END
and nothing would be done about it . END
UNK , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him . END
UNK was like he was . END
she lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or UNK by circumstance . END
when he regained consciousness he was in lord's house , in the office of doctor lord , the UNK deceased father . END
the brannon outfit -- known as the UNK because of its brand -- reached UNK creek before sundown . END
the herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's UNK . END
two of the new hands , a mexican named UNK UNK and a kid known only as UNK , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd . END
the rest of the crew UNK their mounts and turned them into the UNK . END
they got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the UNK fire , rolled and lighted UNK cigarettes , UNK about . END
there was some idle talk , a UNK discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive . END
but they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the UNK wife and son to join the outfit . END
it especially bothered the older hands . END
the cook , UNK UNK , had arrived there long before the herd . END
he'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon . END
he was UNK a batch of UNK biscuits for the dutch oven . END
supper would be ready within the hour . END
the maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby . END
UNK had UNK the UNK from both tom UNK and his father's wagon . END
hank had gathered wood for a UNK , and his wife was busy at it now . END
conchita kept an eye on the twins and little UNK , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing . END
conchita UNK at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon . END
tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the UNK joined it , which had been at midday . END
he'd come alone , without his wife and child . END
he'd been in an angry mood : conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him . END
she wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife . END
she wished that she could talk to her mother about it . END
not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it . END
but her mother would UNK her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern . END
`` pat , get out of that creek ! ! END
you too , UNK ! ! END
UNK , you'll get mud all over your dress '' ! ! END
even as she called to the children , conchita let her gaze seek tom brannon . END
tomas , she called him -- as the mexican hands did . END
he was in earnest conversation with her father and the old UNK , luis hernandez . END
whatever they are talking about ? ? END
it bothered her that she probably would never know . END
certainly , she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward . END
he would tell her not to pry into UNK affairs -- as though she were a little kid like UNK ! ! END
at the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything . END
they were sitting on their heels , UNK , over by the still empty calf wagon . END
brannon was UNK down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him . END
he held a cigarette in his right hand . END
it was burning away , forgotten . END
his face was clouded with unhappiness . END
he'd told hank maguire and luis hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do . END
they were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned . END
finally hernandez said , `` i could offer you advice , tomas , but you wouldn't heed it '' . END
`` let's hear it , anyway '' . END
`` wait a little while . END
let UNK brannon live in her father's house for a time . END
give her time to miss you . END
maybe she will then come to you . END
after all , you want the UNK as much as you want the boy . END
you need her even more than you need him '' . END
`` she won't change her mind '' , brannon said . END
`` john clayton will see to that '' . END
`` but after a time away from you . END
`` a year , luis ? ? END
how long should i wait '' ? ? END
`` maybe in a year , tomas . END
`` in a year she'll like living in UNK house too much to come back to me '' , brannon said flatly . END
`` and the boy will be too much under his influence by then . END
i've got to take danny away from clayton before i lose him altogether . END
hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father '' ! ! END
`` but to take him and leave his mother behind is not good '' . END
`` in my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? ? END
hernandez looked suddenly uncertain . END
`` that i can't answer , for i can't imagine something like this happening to me . END
maybe i should withdraw my advice -- no '' ? ? END
brannon looked at hank maguire . END
`` and you ? ? END
what would you do in my place '' ? ? END
hank shook his head . END
`` i don't know , tom . END
like luis , i can't see something like this happening to me . END
with maria and me , there's never any problem . END
where i go , she goes -- and the kids with us . END
you're going to need your woman . END
and the boy will need his mother . END
if you take the one , you'd better take both '' . END
brannon shook his head . END
`` i won't force beth to come against her will . END
but i'm going to have my son '' . END
they were silent for a little while , each looking UNK . END
finally luis hernandez said , `` what must be , must be . END
i am with you , of course , tomas '' . END
and hank maguire added , `` so am i , tom '' . END
`` all right '' , brannon said , rising . END
`` we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck '' . END
brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall . END
they had for cover both darkness and a summer storm . END
during much of the UNK ride they had watched a UNK display of lightning in the sky to the east . END
later , they'd heard the UNK of thunder and then , just outside UNK , they ran into rain . END
those who had UNK UNK them . END
the others put on old coats or UNK jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle UNK . END
there were seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff . END
it was to be nothing more than that . END
there was to be no UNK . END
if the bluff failed and they ran into trouble , brannon had told the others , they would withdraw -- and he would come after his son another time . END
he didn't want to put himself outside the law . END
with him were hank maguire , luis hernandez , and UNK son UNK . END
the UNK brothers were also along . END
the seventh man was red hogan , a wiry little UNK with a wild streak and a liking for UNK . END
they were all good men . END
it was dark early , because of the storm . END
also because of the storm , the streets of UNK were deserted . END
lighted windows glowed UNK through the UNK . END
they UNK in before the town UNK office , a UNK building on main street . END
a lamp burned inside , but brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty . END
he'd hoped to catch UNK macklin there . END
`` probably just stepped out '' , he said . END
`` maybe to have supper . END
red , come along . END
the rest of you wait here '' . END
with red hogan , he rode to the welcome cafe . END
hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside . END
`` not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse . END
`` maybe he's at the hotel '' . END
they rode to the UNK house , a little farther along the opposite side of the street . END
they UNK in there , brannon remaining in the saddle while hogan went to look for UNK macklin in the hotel dining room . END
brannon had no UNK . END
he'd put on his old brown UNK coat and it was already soaked . END
but he felt no physical discomfort . END
he was only vaguely aware of the UNK rain . END
he hardly noticed the UNK flashes of lightning and the hard UNK of thunder . END
hogan UNK , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal . END
brannon dismounted and climbed the steps . END
`` he's finished eating '' , hogan said . END
`` sitting with a cup of coffee now . END
it shouldn't be long '' . END
it seemed long , at least to tom brannon . END
he and hogan waited by the door , one to either side . END
macklin was the third man to come out , and he came UNK . END
he was UNK on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain . END
it was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late . END
they closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun . END
`` just come along '' , brannon told him . END
`` don't start anything you can't finish '' . END
`` now , listen '' -- macklin began . END
`` we'll talk over at your office '' . END
`` brannon , i warn you '' ! ! END
`` let's go , marshal '' , brannon said , and took him by the arm . END
hogan gripped the UNK other arm . END
they escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office . END
the other five UNK men followed them inside , crowding the small room . END
his face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms . END
he looked at each of them in turn , brannon last of all . END
`` i'll remember you '' , he said . END
`` every last one of you . END
as for you , brannon '' -- END
`` put your gun on the desk , marshal '' . END
`` now , hold on , damn it ; ; END
red UNK patience ran out . END
he lifted the skirt of UNK coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk . END
`` too much UNK around '' , he said . END
`` don't press your luck , UNK '' . END
brannon said , `` now the key to the UNK , marshal '' . END
`` key '' ? ? END
`` what for '' ? ? END
`` can't you guess '' ? ? END
`` we're putting you where you won't come to harm . END
come on -- the key . END
get it out '' ! ! END
`` damned if i will . END
brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and '' -- END
they moved in on him , crowded him from all sides . END
no man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there . END
his face took on a sudden UNK , became UNK with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing . END
he held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure . END
he swore , and said , `` all right . END
it's here in my pocket '' . END
`` get it out '' , brannon ordered . END
then , as macklin obeyed : `` now let's go out back '' . END
UNK , macklin turned to the back door . END
they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear . END
the door of the UNK was of oak planks and UNK with UNK iron . END
it was secured by an UNK UNK . END
macklin UNK again , not wanting to UNK and open the door . END
they crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in . END
once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building . END
he was UNK threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and UNK the door . END
they returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on houston street . END
its windows glowed with UNK . END
deputy marshal UNK UNK still stood guard on the veranda , a UNK , UNK figure in the murky dark . END
he came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun . END
`` don't try it '' , brannon told him , UNK and starting up the steps with his men following . END
`` don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you '' . END
he strode past the now frightened man , entered the house . END
UNK and UNK UNK remained on the veranda to keep UNK from interfering . END
the others followed brannon inside . END
they trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly UNK and UNK men who probably had never before ventured into such a house . END
they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of UNK smoke , of horses and cattle . END
they UNK mud on the UNK floor , on the carpet . END
their presence UNK the elegance of that room . END
and their arrival caught john clayton and charles UNK off guard . END
the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be UNK . END
for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second . END
but the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had UNK at the warnings laughed with satisfaction . END
for , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them . END
the exception was an iron mountain UNK named william lewis . END
after walking out to his corral that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust UNK up in front of his feet . END
a split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded . END
he'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come . END
but he had found all of the UNK and points of cover deserted . END
there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near . END
lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing . END
he hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread . END
his land had never been plowed . END
he had done his rustling openly and boasted about it . END
he had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them . END
he had cursed at them and threatened them . END
he was a man , those neighbors testified later , who didn't have a friend in the world . END
william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone . END
`` i'll be ready next time '' ! ! END
`` i'll be UNK right back '' . END
he had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again . END
this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious UNK shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area . END
he found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out . END
`` just let me meet up with that damned UNK coward UNK '' ! ! END
`` that's all i ask '' ! ! END
he never got that chance . END
for the unseen , UNK rifleman aimed a little higher the third time . END
a bullet smashed directly into the center of william UNK chest . END
he slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself . END
two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground . END
an inquest was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . END
rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the UNK association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got UNK , the UNK attorney , a colonel baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning . END
it took some time to locate horn . END
he was finally found in the bates hole region of UNK county , two counties away . END
prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . END
but that indictment was never made . END
for tom horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing . END
the former UNK alibi couldn't be shaken . END
the authorities had to release him . END
he immediately rode on to UNK , threw a UNK drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends . END
`` dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said '' ! ! END
`` three shots in that fella UNK he hit the ground ! ! END
you reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? ? END
publicly , he denied everything . END
privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin . END
for a UNK ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do . END
tom horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their UNK worth . END
a good many UNK settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats . END
the company herds were being UNK less often , and cabins and UNK all over the range were standing deserted . END
but there were other UNK who passed the lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors . END
the rustling problem was by no means solved . END
even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing . END
for less than a dozen miles from the UNK land of the dead man lived another UNK who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be UNK on -- a UNK and UNK rustler named fred powell . END
`` fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , andy ross , mentioned later . END
`` everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times UNK '' ! ! END
on the morning of september 10 , 1895 , powell and ross rose at dawn and began their day's work . END
UNK time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack . END
UNK a team to a UNK , they drove out to a UNK creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping . END
andy ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded . END
he looked around in surprise , then noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest . END
the hired man ran over to help his boss . END
`` my god , i'm shot '' ! ! END
and he collapsed and died instantly . END
ross had no intention of searching for the assassin . END
he heaved the dead man onto the UNK , yelled and UNK at the team and got out of there fast . END
but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the UNK the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing . END
a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the UNK hiding place . END
there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots . END
not even an empty cartridge case could be found . END
once again , tom horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately . END
once again , he shook his head , kept his face UNK and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready . END
later , riding in for some UNK enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of UNK , he laid claim to the killing with the vague UNK he made . END
`` UNK cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd UNK announce . END
`` and i sort o' got a corner on the market '' . END
`` tom '' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you UNK them UNK ? ? END
they wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , UNK UNK '' . END
he had lots of friends , then as always . END
even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend . END
no man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a UNK . END
`` well '' , he explained , `` UNK you was a UNK UNK the long rope ? ? END
which would you be most UNK of -- a UNK or a UNK '' ? ? END
`` yeah , i can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree . END
`` but well , it just don't seem sportin' somehow '' ! ! END
`` sportin' '' ! ! END
the tall UNK UNK stared in amazement . END
`` sportin' '' ! ! END
he echoed again in soft wonder . END
`` i seen a lot o' things in my time . END
i found a trooper once the UNK had UNK on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their UNK . END
i heard o' texas UNK UNK a cow thief up in green hides and UNK the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death . END
but there's one thing i never seen or heard of , one thing i just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' UNK a man '' ! ! END
after the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored . END
the lesson had been learned . END
the examples were plain . END
when fred UNK brother-in-law , charlie UNK , moved into the dead man's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice : END
if you don't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as UNK was . END
this was the message found UNK to the cabin door . END
UNK left , within three days . END
all through albany and UNK counties , other men were doing the same . END
houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . END
the small UNK tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying UNK . END
no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer . END
jury , judge and UNK were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could UNK anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long UNK . END
for three straight years , tom horn UNK the southern wyoming UNK , and how many men he killed after lewis and powell ( if he killed lewis and powell ) will never be known . END
it is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every UNK murder in the state . END
it is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . END
for that legend was growing UNK , rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man . END
( the best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about UNK , very good money in an era when top hands worked for UNK and found . END
) rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of UNK . END
( a detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to UNK this in the slightest . END
one thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary . END
the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling UNK out of the upper UNK country in a single week . END
`` my UNK my stock in trade '' , tom mentioned more than once . END
he evidently couldn't UNK that it might be his downfall in the end . END
he had made himself the UNK of the devil to the UNK . END
but to the UNK who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure . END
such ranchers as UNK and clay and the UNK brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown . END
he made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their UNK . END
in the cow camps , tom horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local UNK . END
the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , UNK a dedicated crusade against a UNK new society that was threatening a beloved way of life . END
the wailing , UNK UNK of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him . END
by 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in wyoming . END
when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable , brenner UNK the hotel and faced summers across the counter . END
`` i have a little job for you , charlie . END
i'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor '' . END
UNK voice was oily , but summers wasn't UNK . END
he UNK his lips uneasily . END
`` what is it you want me to do , mr. brenner '' ? ? END
`` it's very simple . END
i just want you to take a message to diane UNK . END
tell her to come here to the hotel '' . END
vastly relieved , summers nodded and started toward the door . END
`` one thing , summers '' , brenner said . END
`` you're not to mention my name . END
tell her curt adams wants to see her '' . END
summers pulled up short , and turned around . END
`` i don't know , mr. brenner '' , he said UNK , beginning to get an UNK of UNK plans . END
`` it doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that . END
couldn't i just '' -- his voice trailed off into silence . END
brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold . END
he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed . END
`` you know , summers '' , he said thoughtfully . END
`` UNK nest ought to have a fire company . END
if someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a UNK '' . END
he started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` tell her to come to UNK room , that adams is in trouble . END
tell her to hurry '' . END
`` yes sir '' . END
his face pale , summers headed for the street . END
curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching . END
he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside . END
the fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that diane's information had been wrong , but curt didn't interpret it this way . END
a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed . END
probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding . END
from the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach black's house without using the street . END
curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees . END
there was a light in black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior . END
curt circled the house and located a barn out back . END
he could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else . END
there was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he UNK . END
he opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him . END
again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the UNK of a UNK UNK on a plank floor . END
he moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition . END
horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the UNK of grain being ground between strong jaws . END
he found a match in his pocket and lit it . END
there were two horses in the barn , a UNK UNK and jess UNK buckskin . END
curt UNK out the match . END
it was certain now that jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was UNK black . END
curt wanted to get jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as UNK a person as the store owner . END
he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved . END
reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the UNK . END
the startled animal let out a terrified UNK and UNK around in the stall . END
as curt had hoped , the house door banged open . END
he slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall . END
curt moved over beside the door and waited . END
presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and jess's smothered UNK . END
the door swung open , and jess said UNK , `` what the UNK the matter with you ? ? END
the horse continued to UNK . END
curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance in its UNK voice . END
jess cursed again , and entered the barn . END
a match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop . END
as he crossed to the side of the stall , curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer . END
`` before you try anything '' , he said . END
`` remember what happened to UNK '' . END
jess caught his breath in surprise . END
he started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it . END
`` that's the stuff '' , curt said . END
`` just hold it that way '' . END
he reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt . END
`` you and i have a little talking to do , jess . END
you won't be needing this '' . END
he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its holster . END
`` damn you , adams '' -- jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock . END
`` we ain't got nothing to talk about . END
if i don't come back in the house , UNK going to '' -- END
`` your UNK brother isn't in the house . END
about now he's probably having supper . END
that long ride the four of you took UNK given him a good appetite . END
now turn around so i can see your face '' . END
there was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen . END
`` you're about as dumb as they come , adams . END
i don't know what you're up to , but when brenner '' -- END
`` you can forget about brenner , too '' , curt said . END
`` it's ben arbuckle we're going to talk about '' . END
`` arbuckle '' ? ? END
`` i don't know nothin' about him '' . END
i suppose you don't know anything about a piece of UNK , either ; ; END
one with blood all over it , UNK blood '' . END
curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . END
`` so help me , crouch , i'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before i do , i'm going to hear you admit killing him . END
who told you to do it ? ? END
was it dutch brenner '' ? ? END
curt was holding jess's gun in his left hand . END
he drew back his arm to UNK the UNK across jess's face , but didn't finish the motion . END
UNK an unarmed man might come easy to someone like jess , but curt couldn't bring himself to do it . END
apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , jess became bold . END
`` having all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , adams ? ? END
if we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' . END
`` no '' ? ? END
curt reached out and dropped jess's pistol back into the holster . END
he retreated a step and UNK his own . END
`` all right , crouch ; ; END
we're on even terms . END
now draw '' ! ! END
sweat UNK out on jess's swarthy face . END
the fingers of his right hand twisted into a UNK , but he didn't reach for the gun . END
curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high . END
`` does this make it any easier , coward '' ? ? END
`` i ain't UNK against you '' , jess said thickly . END
`` i heard how you UNK UNK . END
i ain't a UNK '' . END
you're the kind of bastard who UNK up on a man from behind and hits him with a club . END
i just wanted to hear you say so '' . END
jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides . END
he had found curt's weakness , or what to jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it . END
somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed . END
curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention . END
he had to make jess talk , and he had to do it before UNK black got curious and came to investigate . END
once more he lifted jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . END
he dropped his own beside it . END
`` we'll do it another way , then '' , he said harshly . END
jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by curt's fist . END
with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack . END
curt managed to duck beneath the man's UNK fist , and drove home a solid left to jess's UNK . END
it was like hitting a sack of salt . END
pain shot up curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit . END
he slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught curt with a UNK right which sent him spinning . END
an inch lower and it would have knocked him out . END
as it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move . END
when his eyes began to focus , he saw jess charging at him with a UNK . END
curt twisted to one side , and the UNK of the fork bit into the floor . END
jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose . END
it gave curt time to UNK to his feet . END
the UNK broke off under jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock curt's brains out . END
his aim was hurried ; ; END
so the UNK whistled over curt's head . END
by now curt was seeing clearly again . END
he stepped inside jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them . END
they made jess double over . END
when his head came down , curt grabbed him by the hair and UNK him head first into the wall . END
the building shook , setting the lantern to UNK , and the buckskin to pitching again . END
even black's old UNK began to UNK , and from the house black yelled , `` jess ! ! END
what's going on out there '' ? ? END
jess didn't seem too sure himself . END
he lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall . END
curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor . END
jess had had enough . END
blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt's fists . END
curt was in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit . END
he backed jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man's UNK , and drew back his right fist . END
`` tell me about arbuckle ! ! END
you killed him , didn't you '' ? ? END
`` it was UNK idea '' , jess mumbled , UNK at his nose . END
`` he found out about you and arbuckle talking . END
he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' . END
`` you mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , curt said . END
he let go of the shirt , and jess slumped to the floor . END
turning his back , curt crossed to the stall , reached over to UNK the UNK UNK rope , and waved his hand in the UNK face . END
the buckskin bolted out of the stall . END
curt moved in and picked up his gun . END
he shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster . END
leaving jess's where it lay , he left the stall . END
`` get up , crouch . END
we're going someplace '' . END
jess painfully got to his feet as someone UNK the door . END
`` who's in there '' ? ? END
curt opened the door , grabbed black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn . END
`` you're staying right here for a while . END
this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle . END
i'm going to let him tell it to somebody else '' . END
he shoved black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at jess . END
`` get out of here . END
you're coming along peacefully , or i'll put a bullet in your leg '' . END
jess stumbled through the door . END
curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it . END
black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes . END
`` UNK you UNK me '' ? ? END
`` we're going to marshal UNK house . END
maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it'll make a difference . END
somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' . END
over his shoulder he could see UNK loose grin and the UNK UNK faces . END
`` honey '' , he whispered . END
`` soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the snake -- all by ourselves '' . END
`` sally '' , UNK her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with dan . END
his wounds need dressing now '' . END
mrs. UNK words recalled dan to his lack of fitness for UNK . END
what a spectacle he was , UNK with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an indian , kissing the finest , the UNK , the UNK , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world . END
he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with old UNK . END
`` got a lot to tend to , but i'll get back quick as i can '' , he assured her . END
dan could hear clayton burnside and UNK jackson UNK up their final UNK for rental on the oxen . END
jackson was doing most of the talking . END
so long as UNK pa was coming out best on the UNK , dan didn't feel the need of putting in his UNK worth . END
soon as the burnsides moved on , he'd lead rex down by the river ; ; END
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening . END
damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve . END
if i hadn't got UNK stopped when i did , my UNK all be shot plumb to hell ! ! END
he UNK , picked up his ruined hat , and UNK his lips thoughtfully . END
from the way the wound in his head was itching , dan knew that it would UNK . END
but his only hat was something else again . END
the burnsides , now ready to roll , were UNK deaf to his cry . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him . END
`` i ain't going to fight you no more '' . END
UNK turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice . END
`` i know you ain't '' ! ! END
dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall . END
he moved in close , jerked the handsome , UNK UNK hat from UNK head and clamped it on his own . END
`` here's a present for you '' , he said , shoving his UNK hat down over UNK UNK forehead . END
`` me and UNK trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by '' ! ! END
sally left her UNK to stand beside dan . END
slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight . END
much as they had to look forward to , they didn't UNK a moment of the time they spent seeing them go . END
at first matilda could not believe her own eyes . END
she had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding nothing but UNK . END
and now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front of their UNK wagon . END
seeing them waiting there at the foot of UNK rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , matilda could not speak at all . END
then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward UNK in her UNK face , matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` pa ! ! END
i can see dan . END
and he's with the UNK '' ! ! END
`` what about burnsides '' ? ? END
hez asked , who still believed they'd have them to UNK . END
`` they ain't even in sight '' ! ! END
by then hez could see for himself , and so could the others . END
soon they were all shouting greetings , UNK smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again . END
but even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the UNK of the day . END
nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , UNK the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires . END
then , and only then , with the UNK and dan as their true guests of honor , did the UNK take time to catch up on the news . END
no sooner did they hear of UNK injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action . END
the wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with UNK , before they UNK up the UNK . END
from then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . END
even sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old UNK of `` quitting the UNK when wearing the UNK '' . END
after their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` UNK '' . END
only , they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the virginia UNK and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration . END
but with bill o'connor on the UNK , and gran UNK UNK shouting `` glory be '' and `` UNK '' above their united UNK of the UNK old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration . END
`` UNK '' , rod exclaimed to harmony as he UNK stood by her side among the UNK spectators , `` don't that UNK make you wish the bible didn't say us baptists can't dance '' ? ? END
`` nor UNK , neither '' , she replied . END
`` not that it matters to me , being this far along '' . END
rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied . END
`` come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling UNK again too , gal '' . END
at these words of sympathy and understanding , harmony said generously , `` i don't mind setting here along with gran while you go out and join in the games '' . END
rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` i ain't much of a hand for UNK and UNK , but i'd sure like to get in on the UNK and UNK '' . END
he looked down at his big hands and slowly UNK his long fingers . END
`` don't reckon there's nobody out there , UNK maybe dan , who can UNK me , harmony '' . END
with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs. jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , harmony settled on the edge of the UNK box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her UNK legs , and worried about all that might have happened to sally . END
and she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` farmer in the UNK , farmer in the UNK , UNK the UNK , the farmer in the UNK '' . END
at the sight of UNK happy face and carefree expression , UNK dark , brooding eyes quickly UNK with UNK tears . END
she was glad , completely and UNK glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both sally and dan . END
and she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for rod . END
but she couldn't , not yet . END
not with the memory of her folks and the lost UNK still holding her close . END
out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` the farmer choose his wife '' . END
with a swift UNK of his big arms , he grabbed sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her UNK before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit '' . END
soon the child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle . END
by now harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were UNK and resting , or else UNK off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them . END
no matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal . END
even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness . END
already a few hardy folk from their own train were UNK chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . END
soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them . END
no sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep . END
for matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night . END
even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , UNK sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains . END
next morning , they moved on again . END
`` my UNK UNK '' ! ! END
gran UNK exclaimed , watching their UNK muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load . END
`` a body would swear i floated right up here on a cloud '' ! ! END
rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed UNK . END
`` UNK , gran '' , they said almost in UNK . END
`` that wasn't nothing at all '' ! ! END
leaning forward in her chair , gran UNK UNK UNK face . END
`` how's sally like UNK UNK that UNK little UNK UNK UNK '' ? ? END
`` quit UNK him , gran '' , rod protested . END
`` i ain't UNK him '' ! ! END
gran peered again at the UNK blond mustache shadowing UNK upper lip . END
`` but UNK , i've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon '' . END
the two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with alice . END
`` UNK worse , pa '' ? ? END
dan asked hez , who had UNK back from his team to hold the UNK chair braces in place while his boys swung up the UNK and tied it tight at the ends . END
`` my right UNK stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied . END
`` but the UNK UNK it UNK me UNK we git to rolling '' . END
the three men stepped out to the side to wait for captain UNK signal . END
hez looked up at the high face of UNK rock , official UNK for the raft river UNK , and UNK , `` seems funny that them burnsides never took time to leave their UNK up UNK '' . END
`` wonder what made them hurry so '' , rod UNK , giving dan a sly wink . END
dan grinned , and changed the subject . END
`` from now on , sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and UNK outfit '' . END
`` ain't no sense you eating our dust '' , rod protested . END
`` sally and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along '' , dan explained . END
`` jackson recruited his UNK , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up . END
he's got the UNK running gear in the train now . END
besides , UNK no UNK right for me to follow with my black oxen , so's i can UNK and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch '' . END
captain UNK signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams . END
`` reckon UNK right , dan '' , hez called back over his shoulder . END
`` i'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon '' . END
rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , UNK UNK . END
`` we'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , harmony '' , he spoke UNK , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth . END
`` like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown '' . END
out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn . END
before harmony had a chance to reply , rod cracked his long whip over his thin UNK backs . END
while no larger than dutch springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far UNK and more prosperous . END
men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about . END
although they were forced to maintain a UNK watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their UNK without any particular attention being paid them . END
`` UNK be UNK forth in some bar if he's here at all '' , cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs . END
there were no less than six or seven saloons in UNK , not counting the lower class dives , all UNK for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters . END
`` take one side of the street , and i'll take the other '' , he proposed . END
`` if you spot carmer give a yell before you move in '' . END
UNK assent was tight . END
`` you do the same . END
it's all i ask , stevens '' . END
separating , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars . END
russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero . END
suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief . END
he UNK out of the miners rest with his hopes UNK , and headed UNK for the palace saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street . END
the palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on UNK in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch . END
behind its UNK facade the notorious dive clung like a UNK nest to the rocky ribs of the UNK . END
russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch . END
the front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and UNK an unusually good view of the interior . END
heading for the UNK , cobb glanced UNK through the nearest window , and suddenly UNK aside . END
nerves tight as a UNK , he paused to gather his wits . END
against all expectation , carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the UNK and already so UNK that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him . END
fierce anger surged through russ . END
he fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious UNK on the spot . END
reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he UNK scanned the busy street below . END
stevens was nowhere in sight . END
UNK an exclamation , russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down . END
as luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before pat appeared . END
`` what luck , cobb '' ? ? END
`` he's there '' , he got out UNK , UNK his rising excitement . END
UNK his cartridge belt around , pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side . END
climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door . END
pat pushed through first . END
forced behind him momentarily , russ followed at once and halted two steps inside . END
while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy UNK , with gyp carmer a prominent figure , it was now as UNK and dull as the day before UNK . END
carmer himself was nowhere to be seen . END
a man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables . END
two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the UNK bartender absently polished a glass . END
looking the setup over , stevens started coolly for the rear of the place . END
`` where UNK goin' '' ? ? END
it was the UNK . END
UNK , pat turned to survey him deliberately . END
he did not reply , going on toward the back . END
less assured than the tall , UNK man in the lead , cobb followed UNK , a hand on his gun butt . END
the bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it . END
he said no more . END
a hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an UNK . END
pat moved into it . END
small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side . END
all the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder . END
the door was locked . END
a single kick made it spring open , UNK . END
pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward , a UNK bottle UNK as if to strike . END
russ sprang through to bat it UNK aside . END
with a bellow carmer lunged at him . END
but he was more than UNK , and his faculties were UNK . END
cobb UNK a single powerful UNK that sent gyp UNK wildly and crashing down with a whining UNK . END
he started to struggle up , heaving desperately . END
russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach . END
kneeling , cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned . END
`` okay , stevens . END
i've drawn his UNK '' , he snapped . END
`` go through his pockets , will you ? ? END
if we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of '' ! ! END
UNK methodically , pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing . END
cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope UNK by the moment . END
stevens was UNK over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly rose and lunged toward UNK hat , which had tumbled UNK feet away when he first fell . END
straightening up , his eyes UNK , he held out the battered UNK . END
`` look at this '' ! ! END
inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained UNK , could be seen thin , crumpled UNK of currency . END
UNK ingenious UNK for his UNK had been found . END
`` by UNK , stevens ! ! END
you were right '' , russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of UNK hat . END
`` that is , if we can be sure this is UNK money '' -- END
`` where else would he get it ? ? END
count what you've got there , cobb . END
we can soon tell '' . END
russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any UNK would come by honestly . END
`` it's within a hundred of what UNK had '' , he declared . END
`` we know penny spent some -- and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on '' . END
handing the money over , russ wiped his hands on his UNK as if UNK himself of something unclean . END
his glance at gyp carmer was UNK . END
`` shall we get out of here '' ? ? END
leaving the card room , they moved back through the palace the way they had come . END
UNK looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them . END
pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , pat looked his UNK warning and stepped out . END
he and cobb clattered down the high steps to the street . END
neither spoke till they reached their horses . END
pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow . END
it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to UNK and tell him about it , russ '' . END
he started to return it . END
to his faint surprise russ held up his hand . END
`` not me '' , he ruled decidedly . END
it was you that UNK it down anyway , stevens '' , he pursued strictly . END
`` i'll UNK along home '' . END
`` whatever you say '' . END
pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows UNK . END
`` you owe it to penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . END
`` old UNK wasn't '' , UNK cobb UNK . END
`` he'll know when you tell him . END
but i want this to sink in awhile . END
then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger '' . END
`` pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs . END
`` you're the doctor '' , he returned with a smile . END
`` but i still think UNK an awful nice girl , russ '' -- END
`` you don't have to tell me '' , flashed cobb . END
giving the other a dark look , he hauled his UNK around and trotted down off the street . END
pat let him go , following more leisurely . END
at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for UNK . END
the truth was , the UNK was both bewildered and UNK by his own mixed luck . END
`` UNK always glad to see me over there '' , he UNK UNK . END
yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle . END
over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of chuck UNK part in recent events . END
`` gyp carmer couldn't have known about UNK money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him '' ? ? END
`` it's the second time war ax hands made a play for that money . END
how much of an accident could that be '' ? ? END
nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun . END
in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ; END
but on the range gunfire had a meaning . END
hauling up , russ listened carefully . END
two minutes later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , UNK more distant . END
as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the UNK ranch house . END
he tightened up in a UNK . END
so far as he knew , only his father could be there . END
what did it mean ? ? END
clapping UNK to the UNK he set off at a sharp UNK , with growing alarm . END
his first glimpse of the ranch house across the UNK swells told him nothing . END
still a UNK away , the fresh UNK of guns only served to increase his speed . END
setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee UNK past close to his face . END
when it was followed by a second , whining even closer , cobb UNK sharply aside into a depression . END
he knew now what he was up against . END
whoever was out there hiding in the UNK cover was UNK the UNK house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight . END
cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , russ drew his colt and examined it briefly . END
if he wondered whether the UNK would allow him to pull away UNK , he had his answer a moment later . END
`` over this way ! ! END
he ain't gone far '' ! ! END
a harsh cry floated to him across the brush . END
a carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug UNK fragments from the brush off at one side . END
the would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close . END
UNK , russ looked about hastily . END
toward the west this depression led toward a draw . END
leading his pony , he hurried that way , not UNK till he was well below the level of the surrounding range . END
swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the UNK draw . END
he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind . END
he had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot . END
a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something UNK at his foot . END
a slug had torn half of his UNK away . END
a second twitched his UNK , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm . END
another snarled close overhead . END
`` jumping jerusalem ! ! END
let's get out of here '' ! ! END
at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . END
the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless . END
sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment . END
he heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words . END
he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it . END
UNK hurling the UNK sidewise into an UNK draw , he plunged forward with UNK speed . END
gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range . END
yet he must chance it . END
he clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about . END
early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions . END
and sweeney UNK put its first marks on the combat record . END
every plane that could fly was sent into the air . END
UNK took eight ships and went south across the UNK and along the north coast of UNK to UNK . END
anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . END
UNK with eight was to patrol the leyte gulf area , with his main task to get any UNK before they got to the ships . END
greg himself took two flights , with todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around UNK on the east coast of leyte . END
each plane carried two UNK pound bombs . END
a weapons carrier took greg , todman , UNK , UNK ferguson , and UNK and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . END
it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes . END
no one had much to say . END
the sky UNK down at them . END
there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever . END
the truck dropped them off at the various UNK spread through the jungle . END
donovan snatched greg's UNK from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it . END
his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . END
greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before . END
but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the UNK procedure . END
`` i've got her as neat as i can '' , donovan said , as he dropped the UNK of the UNK harness over greg's shoulders . END
`` but this goddamn climate . END
it's for UNK not airplanes '' . END
`` we'll make out . END
don't you worry , chief '' , greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it . END
see you '' , donovan said as he jumped off the wing . END
the expression was his UNK , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . END
at the UNK time , greg started the engine and UNK out . END
from the time the UNK were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip . END
he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission . END
yet long before the scheduled time for return , donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky . END
greg UNK down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him . END
the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful . END
the UNK heads looked UNK small . END
the control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan . END
greg's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off UNK he saw the clouds were dropping down again . END
to the west , the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes . END
underneath him the sea was a dark and UNK gray . END
water UNK against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of UNK . END
the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it . END
he possessed the fighter UNK horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory . END
he UNK in the warm cockpit . END
the overcast was solid above him . END
as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . END
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from UNK and hope that it didn't close in before they returned . END
greg pushed the radio button on his throttle . END
`` todman , let's try to go under this stuff . END
stay in close and we'll go up the valley '' . END
`` roger , sweeney '' , todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above greg . END
greg took the formation wide around three UNK attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf . END
he dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of UNK , and UNK into the opening that showed against the mountain . END
the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed UNK turn . END
it was only a UNK flight , but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of UNK . END
the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer UNK seemed about to close in . END
if the other pilots were worried , they did not show it . END
the formation remained perfect . END
when the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out . END
he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast . END
although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity . END
once todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him . END
`` somebody beat us to it '' ! ! END
todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation . END
visibility continued to be limited , and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet . END
his UNK were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights . END
he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of UNK claiming a kill . END
but greg's area remained as placid as a florida dawn . END
finally , as time began to run out , he headed into UNK and UNK a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies . END
the low clouds made bombing difficult . END
there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . END
the accuracy was UNK . END
one of greg's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it . END
only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . END
with their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily . END
greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home . END
mercifully , it was still open . END
like a man making a deep dive , greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley . END
he was about to make a gas check on his flight when UNK voice broke in : `` UNK ! ! END
twelve o'clock level '' . END
greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel . END
he saw them , UNK against the gray , but closing fast . END
they were headed straight for each other on a collision course . END
friend or enemy ? ? END
the same old question . END
and only a few seconds to answer it . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
todman said excitedly , and hopefully . END
and then he thought todman might be right . END
his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification . END
he narrowed the shape down to two : either a zero or a u. s. navy type aircraft . END
if it were the enemy , UNK his position was correct . END
japanese aircraft were strong on UNK , american on speed and UNK . END
his present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages . END
but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already . END
but the closing aircraft showed no sign of UNK from their original course . END
in seconds , greg made his decision . END
he pushed the radio button . END
`` sweeney blue , hit the deck . END
todman , you take the one on the left . END
i'll take the middle . END
UNK , the one on the right . END
let's make sure first '' . END
greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` rogers '' . END
the planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully . END
greg's UNK indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees . END
the opposing aircraft continued to come on . END
they appeared to be the enemy . END
greg wished the air corps had continued to UNK planes . END
there was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them . END
it was a box . END
but they could turn and escape to the east . END
greg pushed the radio button again . END
`` todman , drop your second element back . END
if any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces . END
now let's make sure they're UNK '' . END
even as he said it , greg knew they had found the enemy . END
the shapes were unmistakable and the rising UNK were showing up , slightly brighter UNK in the gray gloom . END
greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight . END
the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him . END
`` arm your guns , UNK '' . END
they're UNK '' , came a high-pitched voice . END
`` greg to sweeney blue . END
you'll bust your ass in this canyon . END
that's an order '' . END
he moved the flights over against one wall . END
it gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a UNK that would not take them into the overcast or force a UNK recovery . END
if the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out . END
a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done . END
greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and UNK up the rpm , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting . END
the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around . END
`` they haven't seen us '' , greg yelled to himself over the engine noise . END
`` they haven't seen us '' . END
he hit the radio button . END
`` now , UNK , now . END
let's take 'em home '' . END
he hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag . END
out of the corner of his eye , he watched his UNK move out a bit and shoot up with him . END
perfect , he thought . END
with the rapid rate of UNK , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done . END
just like shooting at a duck while performing a UNK from a diving board . END
he tightened his turn . END
it was going to be dangerous . END
eight aircraft in this small box . END
please , dear god , make my pilots good , he prayed . END
he took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another . END
the enemy did not UNK . END
it did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted . END
greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger . END
the plane UNK and slowed . END
six red lines UNK their way into the gray and vanished . END
as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them . END
greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered . END
luck was with him . END
his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane . END
the UNK UNK flew off in pieces . END
a large piece of engine UNK vanished . END
it was all greg had time to see . END
his maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost UNK and heading up into the clouds . END
his speed was dropping rapidly . END
if he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . END
UNK , stay clear , he prayed . END
he pushed stick and UNK and entered the overcast on his back . END
he fought the panic of UNK . END
he had no idea which was up and which was down . END
he held the controls where they had been . END
sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip . END
his air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out . END
over the rattling of UNK , humming of tires and chattering of UNK there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles . END
cool air moving slowly through the open or UNK side windows hinted of blooming roadside UNK , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat . END
`` moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone i once more repeated the absurdity , UNK all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced . END
we were coming to an intersection , turning right , UNK to a stop . END
forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican : moriarty , new mexico . END
adios '' , i said , UNK my spanish vocabulary on my host and UNK one of a UNK store of smiles with my host's daughters . END
i waved with discretion and UNK to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the UNK of the back window glass . END
then i saw the father's head slightly turn ; ; END
UNK rainbow shapes replaced the poignant UNK of gold . END
UNK and UNK drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my UNK and accusing gaze . END
suddenly a UNK auto horn UNK , and , UNK hopefully , i saw UNK in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the leering face of old UNK . END
`` UNK '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly UNK those of the glittering blonde . END
over the UNK outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage UNK black UNK was just discernible , near , or UNK near that spot where -- hidden -- more UNK , most beautifully UNK hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly UNK with UNK and UNK flowers and engine fumes . END
i would have UNK my romantic chances rather than leave a friend UNK and dusty and -- well , at least i wouldn't have shouted back a taunt . END
still nursing anger i UNK UNK a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly UNK me . END
just as i straightened up with my UNK bag , i heard : `` UNK UNK , meet mrs. major j. a. roebuck '' . END
the voice was that of johnson , tail UNK off another crew . END
squeezing a look between johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still UNK lady inquired `` y'all UNK '' ? ? END
`` UNK one UNK '' , mrs. roebuck continued . END
`` UNK goin UNK UNK UNK UNK in sante fe , an y'all UNK UNK the UNK UNK . END
but corporal johnson has UNK said it UNK make no UNK UNK '' . END
i said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as i knew . END
how far i knew will shortly become apparent . END
let me pass over the trip to sante fe with something of the same speed which made mrs. roebuck `` UNK if the UNK speed limit '' ( 35 m.p.h. ) `` is still in UNK '' . END
i let up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m.p.h. which would , i hoped , UNK UNK and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had i , mrs. major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the UNK UNK she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs. somebody in sante fe . END
when johnson UNK `` UNK my buying us all a nice cold UNK , ma'am '' ? ? END
mrs. roebuck UNK declined and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` UNK a little UNK than you UNK '' . END
johnson never would have believed she had a son that age . END
mrs. roebuck thought johnson was a `` sweet UNK UNK UNK UNK '' , but her herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it . END
`` just UNK he left UNK his UNK we UNK UNK UNK on the UNK , major roebuck an ah , an UNK says ' may ah UNK one too ' ? ? END
just as UNK an -- an UNK , an ah says ' uh UNK you UNK ' , but he says ' UNK UNK , you ah UNK one ' ? ? END
an ah UNK UNK him an so ah said ' UNK right , ah UNK , an his UNK UNK UNK one UNK an UNK UNK was gone , the UNK laughed an UNK me UNK he an the UNK had been UNK an occasional drink UNK UNK a yeah , UNK an occasional one , but just the same it was UNK UNK back , an ah UNK think UNK UNK at all , UNK '' ? ? END
`` no , i don't '' , johnson said . END
`` i'm a good baptist , and drinking '' END
mrs. roebuck very kindly let me drive through sante fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to UNK and then UNK and `` UNK '' out of new mexico . END
how lightly her `` UNK '' passed into the UNK where i was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed UNK , and how the word would echo . END
hardly had mrs. roebuck driven off when a rusty UNK truck , father or grandfather of UNK `` UNK '' ford UNK , came screeching to a UNK stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by UNK of what had once been the side window . END
`` get in , buddies . END
the straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back . END
johnson UNK the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely UNK fragments of glass , and johnson UNK himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer . END
`` in back , buddy '' , the driver said to me . END
quickly but carefully lowering my UNK bag over the low UNK , i stepped on the running board ; ; END
it flopped down , sprang back up and UNK my UNK . END
the truck was hurtling forward . END
i seized the rack and made a UNK UNK just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my UNK bag -- and merely wrecking my camera , i was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the UNK truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report . END
i was again in motion and at a speed which UNK the UNK similarity to UNK UNK ford turtle . END
maybe i would beat old UNK to siberia after all . END
whatever satisfaction that might offer . END
something pulled my leg . END
i drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick . END
but it was only johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing , which half covered the truck UNK UNK rear window . END
the way his red rubber lips were stretched across his UNK little teeth i thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear . END
`` wanna beer '' ? ? END
`` hell , yes '' , i roared back between dusty lips . END
did i want a beer ? ? END
did an UNK want ants ? ? END
`` UNK , UNK . END
UNK '' , i UNK , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary . END
at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish , but -- the driver's white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly UNK beyond his glistening hair , beyond his UNK bottle -- it could have been the UNK oxford english i was half hearing ; ; END
i wouldn't have known the difference . END
johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the UNK of the truck was throwing him away from it . END
white teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against johnson's ear . END
we were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut . END
i ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the UNK . END
we were in a field , in a tight , screeching turn . END
prairie dogs were popping up and popping down . END
when i fell on my back , i saw a vulture UNK . END
just as i got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and i had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously . END
this time no wire came whipping into the truck . END
we were back on the road . END
i regained my squatting position behind the truck UNK rear window . END
johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks UNK beneath his fingers . END
`` UNK '' , the driver UNK , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing . END
`` that was UNK i was talking . END
you thought i was a mexican , didn't you , buddy '' ? ? END
`` hell , that's all right , buddy '' , the indian ( i now guessed ) said . END
`` drink your beer '' . END
UNK , the bottle was still in my hand , foam still UNK over my ( UNK ) UNK watch . END
no sooner had i started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck . END
the beer foamed furiously . END
teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of spanish in which `` UNK '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound . END
i UNK my head each time it appeared . END
suddenly the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch '' , sometimes UNK by vicious UNK of a beer bottle into johnson's quivering ribs . END
a big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning . END
beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way . END
the car was just about to us , its driver's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in sante fe -- on anything but an old UNK truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue . END
i tossed the bottle . END
high , so it would only bounce UNK but loudly off the car's steel roof . END
on UNK roadway the bottle shattered into a small UNK flash . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
the indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the indian's lips . END
another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . END
i started looking on the UNK truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt UNK -- anything i could throw and with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle . END
in the ditch sand was white and UNK , only an occasional UNK discernible , faintly gleaming . END
but johnson couldn't quickly UNK the truck door , and if i escaped , he might suffer . END
the car was approaching fast . END
on the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; ; END
with more time i could have loosened a small burr or UNK pin -- END
suddenly and not a second too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket . END
there was no time to pick out a penny ; ; END
i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and UNK my little missile . END
there was a UNK just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ; END
the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center . END
i heard the UNK of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me . END
looking back i saw a UNK man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number . END
johnson's fat hand , another bottle were UNK from the truck cab , and that UNK baptist UNK , had a bottle at his own lips . END
two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing . END
the indian's arm whipped sidewise -- there was a flash of UNK and UNK , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car . END
brakes shrieked behind us . END
i saw johnson's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a UNK of foam just behind the second car . END
this time there was no sound of brakes but the UNK of women . END
i looked back at pale UNK framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window . END
`` drink , you son of a bitch '' ! ! END
i quickly turned around and began to drink . END
but the indian was UNK another bottle toward johnson . END
i guided her to the divan , turned off the tv , faced her . END
she sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes . END
and what eyes they were . END
big and dark , a melting , golden brown . END
eyes like hot honey , eyes that UNK . END
plus UNK skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them . END
it was a UNK familiar face , too , but i couldn't remember where we had met . END
i said , `` do we know each other , miss '' ? ? END
`` no , i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all i could think of was '' -- this time she stopped the rush of words herself . END
shall i go on '' ? ? END
it was her first smile . END
but worth waiting for . END
`` but one word at a time , o.k. '' ? ? END
she was still hugging the stained coat around her , so i said , `` relax , let me take your things . END
would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? ? END
`` no , thanks '' . END
she stood up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and i let out a UNK , UNK sound like a UNK blowing out . END
she was wearing nothing beneath the coat . END
she jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough . END
there had been a good second or two during which my UNK had been blowing out , and now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before . END
`` i forgot '' ! ! END
`` oh , do forgive me . END
i'm sorry '' ! ! END
`` i forgive '' -- END
`` that's what started all the trouble in the first place . END
oh , dear , i'm all UNK '' . END
`` you and me both , dear . END
haven't we haven't i seen you . END
i mean , surely we've '' -- END
`` you may have seen me on tv '' , she said . END
`` i've done several filmed commercials for '' -- END
then it hit me . END
`` zing '' ! ! END
`` why , yes . END
and you recognized me '' ? ? END
`` yes , indeed . END
in fact , i was watching you on that little UNK screen when you rang my bell . END
man , you rang -- it was in color , too , miss , and miss ? ? END
what's your name , anyway ? ? END
ah , you were splendid '' . END
i sat by her on the divan . END
in a UNK and all that '' . END
`` that's the last one we did . END
that was a fun one '' . END
it was fun for me , all right . END
i don't mean to pry , but do they hide the UNK with the bubbles ? ? END
i mean : is advertising honest ? ? END
`` it depends on who does it . END
i never wear anything at all . END
it wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' . END
`` i couldn't agree with you more '' . END
`` i really do have something important to tell you , mr. scott . END
about the murder '' . END
oh , yeah '' , i said . END
`` tell me about the murder '' . END
zing was the creation of two men , louis thor and bill blake , partners in zing ! ! END
they'd UNK the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` UNK '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a UNK advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit . END
their product had been endorsed by good housekeeping , the a.m.a. , and the veterinary journal , among other UNK of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you didn't bathe . END
my lovely UNK -- joyce holland was her name -- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of louis thor . END
the water in thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , UNK UNK -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and UNK in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled . END
the finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy UNK of joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender UNK , and i had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ; END
even to clean men and boys . END
joyce went on , `` when we'd finished , lou -- mr. thor -- asked me to stay a little longer . END
he wanted a few UNK for magazine ads , he said . END
everybody left and i stayed in the pool , then lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too . END
and he didn't have any clothes on '' . END
`` he didn't '' ! ! END
`` yes , he didn't . END
did , i mean '' . END
`` did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on . END
anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' . END
`` you got away , didn't you '' ? ? END
he caught up with me once and grabbed me , but i was all covered with zing -- it's very slippery , you know '' . END
`` i didn't know . END
i wouldn't have the stuff in the house . END
but i'm pleased to hear '' -- END
`` so i just scooted out of his UNK . END
i swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car . END
the keys were still in it , and i was miles away before i remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where i'd changed '' . END
she'd driven around for a while , joyce said , then , thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on UNK UNK drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool . END
while several yards from it , still concealed by the UNK , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge . END
`` a man was holding onto lou , holding him up . END
maybe lou was only unconscious , but right then i thought he must be dead . END
the man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana . END
there's a walk there that goes out to UNK drive . END
i was so scared well , i just ran to my car and came here '' . END
`` you know who the other man was '' ? ? END
`` no , i never did see his face . END
i didn't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and i was so scared it was just somebody in a man's suit . END
but i'm sure the other one was lou '' . END
what joyce wanted me to do was go to thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and UNK containing her identification . END
she realized i'd have to notify the police , but UNK hoped i could avoid mentioning her name . END
her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an UNK tv series , underwater western eye , a UNK show to be sponsored by UNK UNK . END
but if joyce got involved in murder or UNK scandal , the role would probably go to the UNK wife , mrs. UNK UNK . END
or at least not to joyce . END
`` and i so want the part '' , she said . END
`` the commercials have just been for money , there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in underwater western eye i'd have a chance to act . END
i could show what i can do '' . END
as far as i was concerned , she had already and had UNK shown what she could do . END
but i promised joyce i would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort . END
seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those UNK smiles , and i smiled all the way into the bedroom . END
there i got my colt special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room . END
joyce UNK a little on the divan . END
`` i'm starting to itch '' , she said . END
`` itch '' ? ? END
`` yes , i'm still all covered with that soap . END
i was loaded with suds when i ran away , and i haven't had a chance to wash it off . END
UNK , it sure UNK '' . END
`` you might as well wait here while i'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' . END
`` oh , i'd love to '' . END
i showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` if you really don't mind , i think i'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub . END
that always UNK me . END
doesn't it you '' ? ? END
`` only when i do it '' . END
i shook my head . END
one of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color . END
`` soak as long as you want , joyce . END
it'll probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with you . END
so you'll have everything all to yourself , UNK '' END
i looked at my watch . END
time to go , i supposed . END
`` well , goodbye '' , i said . END
you'd better hurry '' . END
`` oh , you can count on that '' . END
`` don't hurry too much . END
i'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' . END
that was all she said . END
but suddenly those UNK eyes seemed to have everything but UNK of bees in them . END
however , when there's a job to be done , i'm a UNK of grim determination , i like to think . END
i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door . END
as i went out , i could hear water pouring in the shower . END
she wouldn't be taking a cold shower . END
hell , she couldn't . END
UNK UNK drive is only two or three miles from the UNK , and it took me less than five minutes to get there . END
but the scene was not the quiet , calm scene i'd expected . END
four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars . END
lights UNK in the big house and surrounding grounds . END
i followed a UNK gravel path alongside the house to the pool . END
two uniformed officers , a couple of UNK i knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left . END
at the pool's far end was the little cabana joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of UNK UNK . END
a few yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green UNK . END
lieutenant UNK , one of the UNK , spotted me and said , `` hi , shell '' , and walked toward me . END
`` UNK you hear about this one '' ? ? END
i grinned , but ignored the question . END
he didn't push it ; ; END
UNK worked out of central homicide and we'd been friends for years . END
he filled me in . END
a call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine p.m. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now . END
present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed louis thor -- had been thor's partner bill blake , and UNK rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account . END
neither of them , i understood , had been present at the UNK session earlier . END
`` what were they doing here '' ? ? END
`` they were supposed to meet thor at nine UNK for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this UNK stuff '' . END
`` yeah , i've heard more about UNK than space exploration lately . END
what is the UNK '' ? ? END
`` how would i know ? ? END
that was the new advertising angle -- something about a UNK of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient . END
actually , only two men know what the formula is , blake and '' -- he stopped and looked at thor's body . END
i said , `` o.k. , so now only blake knows . END
how's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? ? END
`` can't say yet . END
deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em . END
the UNK might show he drowned instead , but that's what the UNK gives us . END
accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' . END
`` i'll pick murder . END
anything else '' ? ? END
`` according to rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the UNK locker and started hauling him out . END
too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ; END
this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife . END
if it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have been UNK on what to do , and now i understand why they are classics ; ; END
those who wrote them knew people and what made people UNK . END
i worked for my uncle ( an uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild UNK of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in new orleans' UNK UNK , the old french quarter . END
the arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day . END
the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting . END
i had a UNK studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming UNK in the southern sun . END
i had come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there . END
when my uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted . END
the arrangement turned out to be excellent . END
i loved the city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of UNK UNK . END
i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another UNK , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ; END
and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner . END
the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure . END
it was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with UNK and go UNK . END
my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages . END
sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything . END
one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt . END
they were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty . END
she looked more like twenty-five or six . END
it was really a may and december combination . END
my new aunt was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who UNK sex . END
there was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like new orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not UNK me . END
her legs were the full , UNK kind , full UNK like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite ; ; END
the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect . END
you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body . END
the true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an UNK entire body . END
the artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is . END
and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store . END
that she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ; END
i was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly UNK them . END
i thought i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly UNK her cheeks . END
true , she was my aunt , married to an uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , i did not know or much care . END
she was standing with her back to the glass door . END
her form was UNK and with the strong light i could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired . END
as it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something UNK . END
something clicked in this instance , but i treated her UNK and i felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance . END
when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was UNK lest my uncle notice it . END
and then i became aware that she , too , glanced at me UNK . END
i felt that her eyes were UNK me as if she were a painter and i a nude model . END
i dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship . END
when our eyes met the air was filled with an UNK message of `` me , too '' . END
you have probably experienced this . END
it is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity . END
why she married him i do not know . END
i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me . END
he already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who UNK the joys of living . END
perhaps , with my uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ; END
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ; END
some women with father UNK do . END
for several weeks we eyed one another almost like UNK partners , and then one day uncle was slightly UNK and stayed home ; ; END
his bride opened the store . END
i was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle's UNK . END
even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a UNK flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights . END
the UNK depth , UNK with UNK , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk . END
she placed her palms , fingers UNK , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` now , what next '' ? ? END
i was aware of a UNK look in her eyes that told me the time was UNK . END
there was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour . END
i was standing beside her , watching the UNK palms and wondering about the old UNK sofa against the wall on which he sometimes UNK . END
i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms UNK me in a UNK crush . END
her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender . END
i heard her UNK , `` we'd better lock the door '' . END
it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch . END
when we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : END
`` he will not always be UNK '' . END
i was thinking about that . END
how will we work it out '' ? ? END
`` i don't know '' , she said . END
`` you're the man . END
you figure it out . END
i've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' . END
`` i guess we both felt it '' . END
`` i guess so '' , she said . END
`` but now what '' ? ? END
even as i said it i realized that an education can be invaluable . END
`` i know what we can do '' , i said . END
`` tell him i made a pass at you '' . END
she raised a protesting hand with a startled air . END
`` what are you trying to do ? ? END
get thrown out ? ? END
if i even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? ? END
`` i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think i will . END
i think i have a way so we can carry on without his UNK us '' . END
`` by telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ? END
`` when i was in college '' , i grinned , `` i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class . END
i don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets . END
in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some UNK to tell ; ; END
and now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us . END
tomorrow UNK UNK opens officially . END
a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and UNK , and having a ball . END
there will be romance and UNK . END
if you tell him i made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said or did , so instead of just telling him i made a pass , say i tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a UNK i really am . END
we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake UNK . END
and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead . END
you are both the same size . END
he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask . END
when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' . END
`` but you '' -- she began . END
`` don't worry about me . END
it will turn out all right '' . END
`` i don't understand '' , she insisted . END
`` are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ? END
`` no '' , i chuckled , `` i'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' . END
as we expected , on the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning . END
i felt that he looked at me coldly and UNK and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife . END
i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days . END
i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date . END
shortly before nine i drove my UNK to the street facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view . END
a few minutes later i saw my uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner . END
i must say the figure was well made up . END
if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him . END
in one hand he gripped firmly a UNK though there had been no indication of rain . END
i suspected why he brought it along . END
in the half darkness i approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me . END
he was looking out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without wasting words i UNK him hard across the face . END
`` you cheap bitch '' ! ! END
`` you cheap , no good , UNK bitch ! ! END
you get a good , loyal husband -- smack ! ! END
-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! ! END
you should -- smack ! ! END
-- be ashamed of yourself . END
he had better write a postcard to walter . END
he opened the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to robert UNK imaginative interpretation of the creation of the UNK from UNK UNK ) were the names of four munich bars and meredith UNK address . END
the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer . END
the code , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , nicolas was determined to find out and put to use . END
a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith , and that might be good for something . END
nicolas called on his muse , a line came back : END
`` UNK , man , and all the UNK are UNK UNK '' . END
that ought to draw a laugh , nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind . END
and indeed , his postcard did draw from walter a letter recommending his friend , the poet nicolas manas , to his friend meredith UNK . END
five days later , on receiving it , meredith sat drumming his UNK on his writing table . END
his hand was large and square and heavily tanned . END
the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt . END
his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months . END
he had returned to the pension a week ago . END
now , he was just in the late poems of UNK and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next UNK class preparation . END
he was determined to spend an UNK summer . END
well , maybe manas wouldn't call . END
UNK fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him : UNK UNK , die UNK UNK . END
the menace of manas gradually faded as meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' how the dark UNK laughed ' ? ? END
or , more UNK , ' the swarthy witches are laughing ' ? ? END
and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas . END
but nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning . END
not by the UNK sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ; END
but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him . END
should she wake him ? ? END
she didn't have the heart . END
her heart , her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly UNK by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from UNK . END
she was just not able to break the spell . END
( would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of UNK marked bars ? ? END
nicolas : `` look , nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ? END
so if all these UNK was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' . END
ballet dancer : protests , tears , and `` take what you want , nicolas , i am a dancer , you are a poet , it is all beautiful '' . END
to this meek UNK nicolas had replied , `` o.k. i can use this blanket . END
and when you get off this job tonight , well , you can UNK something to eat '' . END
and , as a matter of fact , nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that UNK early mornings even in summer are laden with UNK . END
he had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms . END
he used the blanket for late morning UNK when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions . END
mary jane UNK knew none of this . END
) her nicolas lay curled in the sun like a UNK , black hair falling over his eyes . END
she was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth . END
this was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised . END
that long night with nicolas and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes . END
his advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had UNK his hair -- this was all new . END
her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith . END
the next day he was gone . END
mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined . END
even so , it took her several days to force walter to tell her UNK whereabouts . END
packing a small suitcase , informing her husband whom she found in UNK bar that she was taking a train to germany to get away for a while , patting his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours . END
she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens . END
`` dear girl '' , walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens '' . END
`` how like him '' ! ! END
mary jane had UNK said . END
`` his address '' , walter added , `` is that great UNK home , the american express . END
and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband . END
'' for the last half hour mary jane had UNK half the length of the gardens and , at last , come upon her knight . END
his presence there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the UNK of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels . END
she set down her suitcase . END
should she wake him ? ? END
smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched . END
the sun grew hotter as it approached the midday . END
nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the UNK of a speeding car . END
in his dream he cried , `` slow down , for UNK '' ! ! END
he half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass . END
his nose was UNK . END
he blew his nose UNK between his fingers . END
he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs . END
he belched , he stretched . END
mary jane got up , quietly , and walked away . END
twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the UNK pension , her tears dried , signing a hotel form and asking for a bath . END
mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities . END
she had retreated to this world . END
the grafin , who was UNK by her , told her , `` your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair . END
families are very interesting . END
nevertheless , there is no bath . END
but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once . END
and then we shall see . END
'' ( the grafin was partial to the word shall . END
meredith was irritated when the grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` she is a great beauty ! ! END
shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ? END
actually , she is a sad beauty , i believe . END
you shall see her at dinner '' . END
rather UNK he listened to the bath water running ; ; END
when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way . END
before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day . END
a thing he did not like doing , generally . END
singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his italian sun tan . END
he UNK his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of UNK as he washed . END
in the small gallery used as the UNK dining room , meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began UNK the young UNK . END
he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table . END
it would be literary license calculated to UNK life to say that he , oh , dropped his UNK , so startled was he by mary UNK beauty . END
yet he did drop his UNK with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the grafin as UNK that here , indeed , was something special . END
mary jane had made very little effort . END
above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green UNK sweater with , as he soon perceived , no UNK beneath . END
her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders . END
perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day . END
she had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip UNK which made her lips glisten but no UNK than usual . END
the result was grace and modesty . END
as she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with UNK of intelligence and control . END
meredith began falling in love . END
soup : `` only this morning '' ; ; END
UNK UNK : `` oh , i couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! ! END
wine : `` then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? ? END
fruit UNK : `` if you think i would understand it '' ; ; END
`` what a beautiful room . END
like as if it were built of books '' . END
having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , meredith grinned and took down a little UNK of books bound together in old UNK . END
opening these he brought out a UNK bottle and small gold UNK glasses hidden inside it . END
`` i think the maids UNK in the afternoon '' . END
`` those sweet girls ? ? END
it tastes a little like UNK . END
what's its name ? ? END
UNK '' she whispered UNK to herself , several times , UNK it . END
`` would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? ? END
UNK voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ; END
in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the UNK , poetry center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy . END
his new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed . END
the husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite , UNK her hands that UNK my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night , '' ( mary jane asked herself if meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ? END
) but he read on . END
in the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` in dull domestic UNK i watch her staring face , still blind , start UNK in obedience to dirty waters , counters , pots and UNK , waiting below stairs , in her mind '' . END
mary jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words . END
`` oh , it's that myth , about UNK and what is her name ? ? END
i can never UNK it '' . END
she repeated `` UNK '' . END
the third time rather urgently . END
but with her hand poem again . END
she raised her face and nodded , `` it's sweet , and very sad '' . END
they discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds . END
they finished the small bottle of UNK . END
she confessed she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ? END
she began to explain , `` there was this poet , in italy '' he interrupted , `` please don't judge all poets '' . END
at her door , two or three hours later , mary jane whispered , `` everyone is asleep '' . END
kissing her he whispered , several times , `` UNK '' . END
the third time rather urgently . END
but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , UNK , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth . END
they were west of the UNK , but only god knew where . END
for three days , their UNK oxen had UNK up a blazing valley as flat and UNK as a dead sea . END
UNK glare UNK their eyelids an angry crimson ; ; END
suffocating air UNK their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; END
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs . END
and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , UNK and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the UNK wall of fiery orange brown haze . END
ben prime extended his UNK stride until he could lay his UNK across the noses of the oxen . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
he commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips . END
he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut UNK through the dust film upon his gaunt face . END
the UNK saliva came from his mouth like UNK cotton . END
he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , UNK the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his UNK limbs . END
the burning air dried his UNK clothes in UNK patches . END
he cleared his throat and wet his lips . END
as cheerfully as possible , he said , `` well , i guess we could all do with a little drink '' . END
he UNK the dipper and drew water from a barrel . END
they could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by UNK . END
the water was warm and stale and had a UNK taste . END
but it was water . END
thank the lord , they still had water ! ! END
he UNK his mouth with a small quantity . END
he took a long but carefully controlled UNK . END
he UNK the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck . END
she took it grudgingly , her dark eyes UNK as they met his . END
she drank and pushed back her UNK UNK to wet a UNK and wipe her face . END
she set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on UNK . END
`` what happens when there's no more water '' ? ? END
she was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive . END
her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal . END
her temper UNK like charcoal when it first lights up . END
and all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly . END
a ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice . END
`` there must be some water under there '' . END
he tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river . END
`` we can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently . END
`` and add fever to our troubles '' ? ? END
`` or do you want to see if i can stand fever , too '' ? ? END
`` we can boil it '' , he said . END
`` we're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely . END
`` the tires are rattling on the wheels now . END
they'll roll off in another day . END
there was no valley like this on your map . END
you don't even know where we're headed '' . END
`` hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west . END
somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' . END
`` maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' . END
his wide mouth compressed . END
in a way , he couldn't blame her . END
he had picked out this UNK trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon . END
it had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out . END
it wasn't the UNK and UNK and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her . END
she had hated the whole idea before they started . END
actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him . END
it had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a UNK of UNK , administered by her mother . END
the bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound . END
she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a UNK . END
he had left her UNK , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time . END
but each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper . END
he stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , UNK hands . END
`` i suppose '' , he muttered , `` i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' . END
`` don't try to be noble '' ! ! END
her laugh was hard . END
`` they wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around '' . END
`` hettie , they didn't sell you '' , he said UNK . END
`` they knew i was a good UNK farmer back in carolina , but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our own . END
they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them . END
without money or property , what would you have had at baton rouge '' ? ? END
`` i might have UNK , but at least i wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! ! END
he darkened under his heavy burn . END
his blue eyes sought the UNK sea of haze ahead . END
to his UNK , there suddenly was no haze . END
the valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the UNK line of gaunt , UNK hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead . END
then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , UNK clouds that formed even as they sliced over the UNK of the surrounding hills . END
he had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in carolina . END
he UNK hoarsely , `` hang on '' ! ! END
and UNK the oxen as he yelled . END
he wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm . END
too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge . END
he swung up over the wheel . END
`` you had better get inside '' , he warned her . END
but she sat on in stubborn silence . END
the clouds UNK downward and burst suddenly into a great black UNK . END
frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , UNK and spitting out UNK and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking UNK . END
the UNK UNK began to whip and shake . END
their world turned black . END
it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . END
the heavens opened , UNK them with hail the size of walnuts . END
and then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that UNK down like water UNK from a bucket . END
walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the UNK like the UNK of flash floods . END
through the UNK of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , UNK big chunks out of the banks . END
the UNK , UNK surface of the river reached the level of the UNK . END
the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising . END
they UNK under UNK covers , listening to the waves UNK against the bottom . END
the UNK cut off abruptly . END
they were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry UNK of the river . END
then the darkness UNK , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight . END
beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out UNK at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills . END
the water level was higher than their UNK . END
only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored . END
there was no real sign of the river now , just a UNK , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere . END
clumps of brush rode down the ribbon . END
now and then , the glistening side of a UNK object showed as it swept past . END
the girl crawled out into the UNK warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling . END
her face was pale but set and her dark eyes UNK with blame for ben . END
out of compulsion to say something UNK , ben prime UNK , `` well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first UNK hit . END
at least , the wheels dug in . END
the soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' . END
his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard . END
she was watching a tree ride wildly down that UNK current . END
somebody was riding the tree . END
it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting UNK an upright branch . END
she did not call out . END
but as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . END
they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend . END
it UNK up into the air , then sinking back , the UNK branch turned slowly . END
the pale UNK of the woman disappeared . END
`` there's the one who's lucky '' ! ! END
the girl murmured harshly . END
UNK eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . END
then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the UNK , needing their comfort more than they needed his . END
it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , UNK his way , for he was not a tall man . END
he let down the UNK and was knocked over by the UNK of water . END
he UNK back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward . END
they were already swollen to bursting . END
of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most UNK . END
it was spoiled now for seed , and it would UNK and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it . END
the oxen might as well enjoy it . END
he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . END
the waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ; END
there was not a UNK of damp mark to show they were receding . END
he doubted if a man could UNK as far as the desolate , dry hills that UNK the valley . END
a terrible , UNK sense of futility swept over him . END
he gripped the wheel hard to fight the UNK of defeat . END
then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen . END
the UNK were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece . END
hope surged within him . END
he swung toward the front to give the news to hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the UNK of her blame and hate . END
still , he felt better . END
a tight wagon meant so much . END
he got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee . END
he poured the water off the UNK and off the flour , UNK the UNK , UNK UNK for biscuits of a sort . END
their UNK and UNK had not suffered . END
he found a jar of preserved UNK and one of eggs that they had meant to save . END
now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie . END
his long nose UNK at the smells of UNK bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time . END
he UNK the slashed sides of the canvas UNK , leaving the ribs and wagon open . END
he looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures . END
he said UNK , `` hettie , i don't figure your things got wet too much . END
that's a good trunk . END
if you want to get them UNK '' END
she said without turning her head , `` after that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be streaked '' . END
he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and UNK upon the wagon ribs . END
UNK , oil , and UNK make the kind of UNK any UNK dreams of . END
i suppose a UNK sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze . END
now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do . END
the UNK were stuck fast . END
we couldn't UNK them . END
i heard a cry from a UNK as a UNK of flame leaped from a hatch and UNK the man's bare back . END
he UNK to the rail and leaped overboard into the UNK waters . END
one especially bad UNK shook lifeboat no. 3 which trembled violently in the UNK . END
brassnose yelled : `` come on , UNK , max step on it , we got a chance now . END
UNK on those ropes ; ; END
the UNK come UNK '' . END
we pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they UNK UNK . END
the UNK was quivering and UNK like an old UNK mare . END
her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water . END
brassnose , max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the boat . END
`` let's get away fast '' , said brassnose , shaking water from his UNK of bleached hair . END
`` that tub is going to explode all at once '' . END
then the UNK seemed to UNK with a roar of live steam , UNK of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of UNK smoke . END
dimly , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that UNK . END
already our UNK lifeboat was filled with five inches of water . END
`` UNK , you bale while we row '' , brassnose commanded . END
as best as i could determine , we were some 700 miles west of new UNK , in the UNK UNK . END
three days previously , we had steamed past barren UNK island in the distance . END
now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific , for this interminable UNK would have to stop soon . END
there were gigantic UNK and rope burns on our hands ; ; END
our muscles were hot wires of pain . END
brassnose was strangely silent . END
the big man with the UNK hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue , which i recognized , having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 , class at the university of chicago . END
he then said something which struck a chord in my memory . END
`` god help us if we're near the island of eromonga . END
we'd be in real trouble then . END
i'd rather keep UNK -- or sink '' . END
i was puzzled by the remark , then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard UNK three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies . END
he had been speaking of this UNK : END
`` even when the islands were under german mandate before world war 1 , , europeans gave eromonga a wide berth . END
the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are UNK of the twentieth century -- stone age UNK who live in an UNK , UNK society which is UNK '' . END
i remembered , too , the UNK voice of a UNK , bobby UNK : `` but how do they reproduce , dr. UNK ? ? END
i'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! ! END
there had been classroom UNK which quickly subsided as professor UNK said dryly : `` i see your point , UNK . END
of course , males play a role there , but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga . END
indeed , you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after UNK them for UNK purposes , or they destroy them by UNK but ingenious methods . END
in fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' . END
`` i think i know what you mean , brassnose '' , i said . END
`` i know something about eromonga . END
let's hope we come to a safer place '' . END
three hours later , while we were UNK desperately , a dot of land came into view . END
foster UNK UNK made a sign over his heart with his two linked UNK : i recognized it as an ancient manu gesture intended to UNK the devil . END
a half-hour passed ; ; END
we had drifted closer . END
in a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big UNK mate UNK : END
it is eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden UNK on the cliff '' . END
i UNK at the looming shoreline . END
there was a wooden tower or UNK there , something like a ski jump ; ; END
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs . END
a fine example of engineering in a primitive society . END
`` what is the UNK for , brassnose '' ? ? END
he made a sound of despair deep in his throat . END
it was embarrassing to see UNK , blonde brassnose UNK himself like a child who talks about UNK . END
it is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death . END
it is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there . END
often , i heard my UNK and cousins speak of it when i was a small boy growing up in UNK . END
they had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers '' . END
our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga , i was glad to see a long and graceful UNK manned by three UNK girls UNK out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft . END
i expected brassnose -- as a man with a strain of UNK in his blood -- to speak to them . END
but he had turned a UNK green and appeared UNK or UNK . END
so , i UNK my few words of the manu dialect and said , `` we greet you in peace . END
my friends and i come from a ship which was destroyed by fire . END
we are thirsty and hungry ; ; END
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' . END
the girl in the UNK of the UNK turned a smile like a beacon on me . END
i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red UNK fruit in her UNK hair . END
she said , `` my name is songau and these girls are UNK and UNK . END
you are welcome to eromonga . END
my people await you on the shore . END
you shall have food , water and rest '' . END
thirty minutes later , the UNK UNK on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder . END
i saw a dozen or so other UNK UNK there . END
all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight . END
there was a mound of bleached human bones and UNK at the base of the big wooden UNK . END
some had been there for years ; ; END
others still had UNK shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them . END
there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me . END
this was also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the UNK face , the painted bone of the warrior UNK which still pierced the UNK of the UNK nose . END
the body may have been two or three UNK dead . END
i looked with revulsion at the legs . END
many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh . END
the man must have leaped to his death from the UNK UNK of the tultul . END
as if UNK my thoughts , the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden : END
`` this is our tultul , a jumping platform , UNK . END
later , you shall know it better . END
is it not UNK ? ? END
our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the UNK festival fifteen UNK ago . END
it took thirty of our women almost six UNK to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one . END
we are very proud of it '' . END
`` you have every right to be '' , i replied gravely in the manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us . END
he looked as if he was going to keel over . END
i felt a UNK in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid . END
not so soon , anyway . END
i clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` this one is the UNK UNK . END
he speaks your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on UNK who made much magic and was strong and cunning . END
the UNK UNK has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' . END
this was the worst thing i could have said . END
brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said UNK , `` UNK , you meddling yank , you're a fool ! ! END
they despise males who UNK of their strength ; ; END
they destroy such men with their damned tests . END
you've ruined me , blast you '' ! ! END
at first , i thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this . END
but a glance at songau and the other women confirmed what brassnose had UNK out . END
the women's faces had hardened after my statement . END
at a nod from songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to UNK side and seized him by the arms . END
the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ; END
but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived . END
besides , terror had UNK some of UNK vitality and will . END
my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face END
in the manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women UNK UNK in weekly UNK at which great quantities of a brew like UNK were UNK . END
in the hut to which i was assigned -- max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled UNK with bare UNK breasts who seemed to enjoy UNK with me in rudimentary phrases . END
her name was UNK and she told me many things . END
for an UNK , UNK old UNK was a mine of information . END
though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive , i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women . END
( her account was later confirmed by the UNK expedition from the university of UNK in 1951 . END
from UNK , i heard that until about UNK the people of this island -- which was about the size of guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of UNK tribes was observed here with minor variations . END
but in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an UNK battle and UNK the women after their men had fled . END
UNK , karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of UNK back to their war UNK , after considerable loss of life on both sides . END
karipo was something of a politician as well as a UNK . END
she quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by UNK the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death . END
within a decade or less , few men were left and a UNK society had sprung up . END
`` karipo was great UNK , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the UNK told me . END
`` all men went away from here . END
those who stayed had to pass tests . END
she UNK with UNK , showing the stumps of UNK teeth . END
`` UNK women then named this place ' eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here . END
come , i show you '' . END
the old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood . END
in the shade of a palm tree in front of the UNK dwelling i saw four figures in a UNK on the ground . END
`` i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home . END
maybe to beat up on his UNK '' . END
benson looked up and saw UNK long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall UNK . END
ramey reached out with the tire iron and UNK a UNK of mud that was UNK on the spare tire rack . END
`` i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' . END
somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver . END
for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened . END
maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault , ramey thought . END
maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us . END
anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at . END
`` ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , UNK '' ? ? END
he said to his partner . END
`` you mean dream '' ? ? END
just see it '' . END
benson grinned and UNK a rock with his thumb like a marble . END
`` UNK , just you , all the time -- sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent partner '' . END
ramey smiled but he thought to himself , i always see me too . END
whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind . END
then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think . END
with this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down . END
`` you seen him yet '' ? ? END
benson said , referring to the indian . END
`` he wasn't in the car '' , ramey said . END
`` you didn't go clear around '' , benson said . END
`` if you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car '' . END
`` too long a waiting line '' , ramey answered , pretending to joke . END
a few minutes later the insurance man , a road UNK , drove up in the gray UNK with license plates on it from a UNK state . END
it was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed . END
sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed . END
all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big UNK straw hat with UNK edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out UNK chopping cane . END
UNK , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist . END
it had always seemed strange to ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an UNK driver like UNK would merely pick something UNK and put it on his head . END
the insurance man informed them that he had talked to UNK who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they UNK the rig back to town . END
he UNK with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer . END
every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then UNK up again as it got clear . END
when they were ready to leave , benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer . END
`` there's a body you won't mind looking at '' , benson said and they stopped . END
she had driven up with her husband in a convertible with eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that . END
she wore shorts and a loose UNK shirt . END
slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply . END
`` what outfit does she drive for '' ? ? END
seeing her caused a UNK in ramey , a recognition . END
she might have been someone he had once loved . END
he had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run . END
the truck routes , the industrial areas with walls UNK with UNK smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back UNK were their access to a city and they could never stay . END
how would you ever see her again ? ? END
the feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning . END
their work was lonely . END
`` what's she doing in this bunch '' ? ? END
benson said , and ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been . END
the girl looked around at the countryside . END
her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing . END
it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on . END
she began to watch a UNK man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had UNK slightly . END
what had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but benson knew what it was . END
the girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when benson , in that barefoot UNK ramey could never decide was real , said , `` you don't want to go around there , ma'am '' . END
the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her . END
the man stood near the bent UNK body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car . END
the two drivers moved closer . END
`` what does he want , a spoon '' ? ? END
benson said to ramey . END
one tiny detail in a happening can UNK the memory and stick like meat in a UNK tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain . END
with ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was UNK the indian's foot that he would always remember . END
the UNK were broken at the bottom of the UNK but there was still a bow knot at the top . END
the slightest UNK would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside . END
the two men in overalls stood just behind the UNK man . END
he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows . END
he turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes . END
he was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a UNK poster . END
`` he's dead , isn't he '' ? ? END
he turned and bent over the body of the indian . END
there was nothing in particular on the man's face . END
it was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine . END
`` what's this '' ? ? END
the man said , backing up a step , still looking down . END
his words were mostly to himself . END
there was a gentle concern in UNK voice . END
ramey looked down and saw the white UNK at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously UNK a bit of folded , UNK substance lying by itself on the pavement . END
`` but what is it '' ? ? END
the man said with a tone of impatience . END
but what is it ? ? END
the man had spoken only once . END
ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or UNK pressing in his ears . END
the UNK reached out once more to tap against the mass and UNK vision darkened except for an UNK clarity of the man's leg . END
ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin . END
he stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` don't do that , fella . END
the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist . END
ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth . END
it was a straight , solid , UNK shot ; ; END
he laid all four knuckles in between the man's UNK and his chin . END
UNK fist and the air expelled from the man's UNK cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together . END
the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement . END
ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand . END
as he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet . END
he hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard . END
with a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him . END
his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open . END
after what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to UNK from it . END
the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth . END
he UNK and pulled the hand away . END
even yet there was no realization in his eyes . END
ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him . END
he did not look around . END
`` what happened '' ? ? END
`` he's hurt '' ! ! END
a woman's voice said , and then he heard a sort of UNK from the man's wife . END
the man on the ground began to move ; ; END
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him . END
blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright v woven into the UNK had melted , running a UNK color . END
the girl UNK by her husband with one arm at his back . END
`` can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ? END
an incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth . END
the girl looked around quickly at several of the people . END
none of the crowd had stepped forward to help . END
then she saw ramey and her face was UNK with UNK . END
`` why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ? END
she said , her voice rising . END
a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again . END
behind ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers . END
no one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out . END
ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman . END
benson moved his arms , UNK with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly . END
ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man . END
some of the UNK was gone from his face and he stared at ramey . END
it's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . END
ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . END
he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the UNK swinging arms and in the leather holster that UNK and rolled at the side of his UNK body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the UNK handles of his pistol . END
`` all right , step back '' ! ! END
the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in UNK . END
he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him . END
`` you all right '' ? ? END
`` UNK -- it's my UNK '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips . END
his brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it . END
then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the UNK head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute . END
the body continued to lash , but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the UNK . END
he slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots . END
he heard their chattering , and then the sounds of UNK as they UNK the snake right on the porch with wood axes . END
it was only then that he turned to look at penny . END
she was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her . END
the fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth . END
but her hands were calm , now . END
she's got guts , thought keith . END
she's got more guts than any other woman in the world . END
`` keith '' , said penny , `` keith , you were wonderful . END
i don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but i am . END
thank you , keith '' . END
he smiled at her sincerity . END
and for the UNK time that week , he was startled at her beauty . END
seven years they'd been married . END
he knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to UNK , even in part . END
but her beauty always surprised him anew . END
`` i realize that this is hardly the time to say it , penny '' , said keith . END
`` but knowing you , i know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because i killed the snake , even though i had to . END
isn't that so '' ? ? END
penny lowered her eyes . END
`` yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime . END
`` the snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ? END
asked keith , his voice getting UNK in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger . END
`` it was a king UNK , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? ? END
penny did not answer . END
now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him . END
`` we're all god's creatures , aren't we '' ? ? END
keith was UNK now . END
`` all of us -- every goddam UNK and worm and killer in that jungle . END
you love this village and these UNK brown people because they're god's creatures , too . END
and you love UNK , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he's a beautiful man . END
and he loves you because you're a beautiful woman . END
we're all god's creatures , aren't we , penny ? ? END
all of us , that is , except me . END
you hate me , you hate my guts , because i like to hunt . END
you actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because i killed that filthy snake . END
well , why don't you say something '' ? ? END
penny would not rise to his mood . END
`` there isn't anything left to say , is there , keith '' ? ? END
she softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because keith was between her and the UNK . END
he knew she was not UNK , not even angry at him . END
just as he knew that she had stopped loving him . END
the UNK has its headwaters in the UNK of the world , the towering white UNK of the UNK that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet . END
for a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the UNK , and then the UNK glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow UNK under the UNK and across the UNK hanging valleys on their long , UNK journey to the sea -- running east past the UNK UNK of UNK UNK and UNK , then turning south and UNK down through the jungles of UNK , past the UNK hills , and into bengal , past UNK and UNK , until the hard water of the melting snows UNK with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to UNK with the UNK salt depths of the bay of bengal . END
keith sterling had looked down on the UNK more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the UNK of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space . END
but keith looked down more than up . END
he thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , UNK beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the UNK . END
at first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war . END
but `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself . END
wing commanders in the UNK do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves . END
and UNK record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive . END
he became a fighter pilot after the stint over the UNK in the big UNK . END
the UNK was britain's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war . END
he knew how to shoot down nazis . END
and he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the UNK on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear . END
that was true , but only half the truth . END
the other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself . END
he enjoyed the killing . END
not defending england , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity . END
and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi . END
nowadays , we talk as though the UNK were just a short skirmish . END
the nazis UNK britain , so the UNK UNK and shot them all down . END
it was a war of nerves , of UNK , of UNK endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an UNK obstacle to the nazis , who were better organized and technically superior . END
it took a long time before the british tipped the balance . END
keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked . END
they grounded him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the command offices . END
that was where he met penny . END
he was aware of her as a UNK good-looking american UNK , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the command offices , but that was all . END
penny knew him better , on her part . END
he had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals . END
they don't go for UNK muscle , as a rule . END
he had strength in his UNK frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a UNK . END
he was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in UNK and UNK . END
his hair was black , already UNK at the temples in the classic UNK , the only one permitted to a man . END
the pretty little UNK UNK said he had the look of eagles -- and penny , UNK the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied . END
keith was an eagle . END
penny and keith had no romance . END
no dates or UNK . END
but they met in one UNK moment that gave them to one another instantly . END
the command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy . END
the nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit . END
this time , they had been lucky . END
the command post was underground , and well UNK . END
but there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps . END
there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as UNK , when a direct hit comes along . END
this one was actually more of a `` near miss '' . END
the bomb plunged into the ground near the post , but not precisely into the command room itself . END
there was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as UNK , as ordered . END
that is , everyone but keith and penny . END
they stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast . END
keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much . END
the bomb was a solitary one . END
the blast damaged , but did not destroy the room . END
UNK eyes met UNK as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction . END
and , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to penny and took her hand in his . END
the chaplain married them , on the next day . END
after the war , penny had wanted keith at least to visit her home with her . END
she came from ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to UNK farmers . END
but to UNK UNK mind , such acreage sounded rather UNK . END
it wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to america . END
keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma . END
he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles . END
he didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself . END
he couldn't stop killing . END
that was his true love , not penny . END
the terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose . END
and in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing . END
when they got to UNK , in UNK , he was happy . END
this is a paradise for hunters . END
this was the land of the UNK , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread . END
the great black UNK . END
the UNK buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the scottish UNK . END
he even hunted elephant , although the asian elephant is not quite as UNK as his african cousin . END
but there are big UNK in both countries . END
these were the ones keith sought out -- the UNK , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself . END
he and penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from UNK in the UNK . END
and while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , penny UNK at the eden they were UNK . END
they came upon UNK deer at UNK pools . END
peacocks UNK across their path , UNK . END
there were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song . END
mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs UNK too close . END
wild UNK watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the . END
now , the next morning , they were anchored at the elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 UNK , with the weighted line beside it ; ; END
and robinson roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface . END
he and his safety man , herr schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together . END
the german UNK indicated that robinson should mount first . END
robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his UNK assembly . END
he took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck . END
`` temper , temper '' , mrs. forsythe said , laughing uneasily . END
a phony blonde hanging onto a UNK youth and beauty , but UNK UNK in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and UNK , though it was not yet ten a.m. END
`` i UNK it '' , rob said , with a savage note in his voice . END
`` all i have to do to set the record is to go on down . END
so instead i come up '' . END
`` was it my equipment '' ? ? END
`` was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ? END
`` the equipment was fine '' , rob stated , standing up . END
he was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual UNK and UNK of manner that was submerged under his present agitation . END
he stared UNK at the floor . END
`` i was down to 275 . END
i've been that far half a dozen times . END
i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick '' . END
`` well , i get it '' , artie said , still on the ladder . END
`` you are a big UNK UNK and you got this idea about setting a record . END
and you also got this little spark in your UNK that tells you to turn around before you UNK yourself . END
so you turn around '' . END
`` no , it wasn't that '' , rob said . END
a note of awe came into his voice . END
`` when i came up , UNK , i thought i was going down . END
i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening '' . END
`` UNK '' , artie said , and climbed in . END
`` that's right '' , robinson said . END
`` i was expecting it , sure . END
but when it happens to you like that , i tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think . END
you don't head back down again . END
not me , anyway . END
not right away '' . END
he had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him . END
waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying UNK , UNK glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat . END
now he was going to show how much he knew . END
`` our boy didn't chicken out , no sir . END
he ran into the UNK of the depths . END
it makes the UNK feel drunk '' . END
`` well , that's the only way to be '' , mrs. forsythe said , and gave her UNK laugh . END
`` maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , artie said . END
`` anyway '' , waddell went on . END
`` it's nothing to fool with . END
it can kill you . END
personally , i don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as i regret losing the story '' . END
`` nobody's giving anything up '' , robinson said . END
he stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ; END
and yet like a child among adults . END
`` you think i got you and artie and herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ? END
i'm going down again '' . END
`` that's my boy '' ! ! END
`` UNK not going to give up as easy as all that '' . END
he was a UNK , UNK man in his early sixties , very UNK in his UNK cap , striped jacket and white UNK . END
he went to key west every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` UNK '' was never used without irony . END
old UNK forsythe , who had once lost a UNK bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first . END
now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again : rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride . END
`` why '' , he went on , `` when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , i didn't think twice about it . END
i've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop . END
hell , i gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , rob '' ? ? END
`` seven years ago , UNK '' , rob said UNK . END
he was thinking , big deal : UNK on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started . END
`` excuse me '' , he said abruptly . END
he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ; END
went into the forward UNK and locked the door behind him . END
`` when you gotta go , you gotta go '' , mrs. forsythe said . END
waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . END
he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley . END
`` hi there , schaffner '' , he had said . END
`` can i make you one '' ? ? END
`` no thank you very much '' , schaffner had answered in his UNK english . END
`` i do not drink so much , thank you '' . END
waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up . END
he was in his early forties , rather short and very UNK built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways . END
his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence . END
waddell had heard that he had been a UNK in UNK UNK corps , and he said to himself : i'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night . END
aloud he had said , making conversation : END
`` rob tells me he's using your UNK equipment on the dive '' . END
`` yes '' , herr schaffner had said . END
`` he's one hell of a decent boy . END
i like that kid '' . END
`` i agree , yes '' . END
`` and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ? END
`` well , no '' , herr schaffner said . END
waddell turned to face him . END
`` no '' ? ? END
`` but that's what he told me . END
why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' . END
UNK looked at him , altogether without UNK , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands . END
`` what do you mean '' ? ? END
waddell asked , frowning . END
`` please let me explain '' , the german said earnestly , his face still devoid of UNK . END
`` i have in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year . END
now i wish to enter the american market , where the competition is very strong . END
i must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to UNK my products . END
with all respect to a fine young man , mr. roy is not able to provide these UNK '' . END
waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard . END
`` did you tell him all this '' ? ? END
`` perhaps not in so many words '' , the german said . END
`` but surely you have misunderstood mr. roy . END
never , never did i offer him the exclusive rights . END
we spoke of the need for advertising , and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity . END
he was most eager to make the dive ; ; END
of course , i was willing . END
but there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' . END
`` well , damn '' , waddell said . END
there was the end of his UNK feature story , with UNK . END
he started out the door . END
`` one moment '' ! ! END
`` you intend to speak with mr. roy '' ? ? END
`` what else '' ? ? END
`` if you will pardon , i think it would be better if not . END
mr. roy is determined to make this dive . END
whatever you tell him he will dive . END
i know this from my talks with him '' . END
`` well , let's let him make up his own mind , ok '' ? ? END
`` on the basis of the facts '' . END
`` you will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the german said . END
`` at 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him . END
it is not good , mr. waddell : you will do him great harm '' . END
there was no doubt that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said . END
waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk . END
`` i am an honest man '' , the german said with fervor . END
`` i will give mr. roy his due for this dive . END
i will make him distributor for all of florida -- a big market . END
all tourists come to florida . END
this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop . END
but there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' . END
the UNK words worked on the newspaperman like a UNK from an UNK duty . END
he took a big UNK of his drink . END
it would be a UNK shame to throw away a story like this . END
`` i think maybe you're right , schaffner '' , he said . END
`` he has the UNK for florida , you say '' ? ? END
`` yes '' , the german said . END
`` at least for south florida '' . END
`` by god '' , waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times . END
i guess you're right '' . END
he UNK his drink around and drained it in a few large UNK . END
the story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , UNK UNK the unknown ; ; END
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern UNK america . END
`` join me in another '' ? ? END
`` thank you '' , the german had said UNK . END
`` i do not drink so much '' . END
now , in that same cabin , robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk . END
fear and relief mingled in his UNK emotions . END
he pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of UNK in a hurried and anxious whisper . END
`` blessed saint nicholas , i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when i was bewildered . END
and when i make the dive again '' -- he paused ; ; END
said a hail mary , slowly and with understanding . END
UNK between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to headquarters . END
`` holy mary , mother of god , star of the sea , stay thou with me on this next dive . END
make it come off all right . END
let me set the record this time , and let me get back ok , so the german will give me the exclusive . END
and make my life different and better from this time on . END
he crossed himself again and rose . END
he felt a good deal less shaky . END
as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk . END
artie had picked up a UNK and was twirling it on his forefinger . END
he waited awhile before he said , `` roy , you know your UNK table , don't you '' ? ? END
`` you know i know it '' , robinson answered UNK . END
`` you came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , artie said . END
`` well , i was a little bit confused . END
anyway , i wasn't down long enough to matter . END
you don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ? END
`` you know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , artie went on , still twirling the UNK and studying it intently . END
`` i don't think you should go down again '' . END
early that day matsuo saw a marine . END
the enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were UNK . END
as his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand . END
he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed . END
in the UNK part of the tree , UNK a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow . END
for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time . END
he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably UNK indecision , they would soon come hunting . END
his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure . END
tomorrow : no surrender . END
his remembering the UNK brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt . END
he murmured to himself , with firmness : `` no surrender '' . END
it was best to die fighting the marines . END
his superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor . END
what if the marines never came ? ? END
his comrades were all dead . END
he had no rice . END
then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide . END
whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an UNK of his ashes . END
he sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk . END
his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife . END
the knife , an ammunition UNK , and a UNK bottle of purified water hung on his belt . END
besides the belt he wore a UNK cloth . END
as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing . END
the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight . END
his UNK made a streak of almost UNK green in the mist . END
`` come out , come out in the meadow '' , matsuo said under his breath . END
the man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face . END
matsuo lifted his rifle , UNK the UNK under his left upper arm for UNK . END
fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills . END
they had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out . END
even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the UNK of UNK UNK great orange UNK . END
a wave of flame UNK through their cave had reached UNK , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing . END
the marines let him advance . END
when he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to UNK without administering the stroke of mercy . END
matsuo had UNK death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the UNK , the latter UNK rapidly under the tropical sun . END
the callous marines had laughed at each other's UNK , while UNK bodies . END
matsuo repeatedly choked down his own UNK . END
at nightfall he had been able to UNK down a hillside and into the jungle , UNK of death . END
apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the UNK , UNK maze . END
he decided that the marines must be UNK around the meadow , with the one left to UNK him . END
he strained his hearing . END
cautious feet stepping on UNK ; ; END
faint creaking of belts and UNK ; ; END
whispers : he heard none of these . END
only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird . END
because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there . END
a spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ; END
leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it . END
humiliation made matsuo tremble . END
while his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver . END
taking aim at the man's face , matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind . END
he wanted the UNK marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head . END
the shot UNK in diminishing UNK of sound . END
like a UNK boy expecting punishment , matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle . END
how stupid to give his position away . END
the jungle did not retort . END
the sitter remained seated hugging the tree . END
before long the atmosphere UNK to its old normalcy , and insects UNK and birds occasionally called . END
matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete UNK , concluding that he was the butt of a UNK joke . END
five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes . END
he went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind UNK of the tail . END
it ended when he tumbled ; ; END
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction . END
he wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon . END
with a sudden UNK he lurched in UNK direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop . END
when he got closer to the tree , matsuo noted the wild look on his face . END
the pockets of his jacket UNK . END
the UNK head was a poor target , so matsuo shot him in the upper trunk . END
the marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward . END
in the UNK that followed the echoes , matsuo was tense . END
they could come on him now without difficulty . END
gradually he reached a conclusion . END
the marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have UNK to knock him from the tree . END
down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage . END
the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended . END
matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out . END
rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush . END
heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd . END
he squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground . END
with a UNK motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back . END
the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right UNK ; ; END
around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch . END
maintaining his clutch on the hair , matsuo watched the closed eyes while UNK in the jacket pockets . END
in one : a package of cigarettes and a UNK lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding . END
in the other : a UNK with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief . END
one by one he tossed the objects aside . END
he didn't smoke and could not light fires with a UNK lighter ; ; END
he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running . END
then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief . END
too bad the marine had no water . END
from its holder he took his own UNK . END
the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty UNK as he applied pressure . END
the marine's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened UNK in the glare . END
matsuo put the bottle to his own lips . END
the marine reached up a hand . END
matsuo shook his head . END
`` none for you '' . END
the marine blinked , soon dropping his hand . END
not only had he no UNK , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on . END
`` you came well equipped to die '' . END
some odor made him lean over the man . END
he sniffed and recognized it . END
so that had been his difficulty . END
drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac . END
the marine tried to roll on his right side , and UNK . END
when he rolled on the left side , UNK on his left elbow , matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over . END
`` be a good turtle '' . END
awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle . END
the smell of sake had UNK yesterday's events in his thoughts . END
in the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake . END
the marine shut his eyes . END
`` are you a UNK of flame , marine '' ? ? END
matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows . END
he waited in his squat , gripping the hair . END
every so often he turned the knife . END
its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight . END
the sun was noon high and matsuo UNK until his body was dripping . END
wet also were the marine's UNK and the face had an oily film . END
the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes . END
now and again he murmured something that ended in a UNK . END
he must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze . END
matsuo shook his head . END
at last he reached for the knife . END
even the bone handle UNK , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it . END
first he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes . END
the marine yelled and flung the hand away . END
with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek . END
a shrill UNK , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled UNK wrist . END
matsuo UNK free and burned the hands into retreat ; ; END
burned the other cheek ; ; END
burned each hand when they came groping again . END
the marine commenced to weep and it UNK the sense of enjoyment . END
`` a small measure of payment , marine '' . END
he dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder . END
the marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his UNK side onto his stomach . END
matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back . END
the marine was still . END
he would soon die . END
as matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow . END
in the jungle , birds were UNK , while insects preserved only the monotony of living . END
it was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called . END
then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat . END
he cupped his mouth and yelled . END
matsuo UNK the rifle off his shoulder . END
once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die . END
he aimed , but listened . END
it sounded as if the man were calling him : `` hey , japanese hey there , japanese '' . END
the man tilted back his head and went through the UNK of drinking from a container . END
he performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct . END
`` sake '' ? ? END
the marine nodded vigorously . END
matsuo laughed , UNK the rifle . END
the marine was a UNK . END
his superiors had said that all marines were UNK . END
the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol . END
remembering his own thirst , matsuo took out his water bottle . END
one swallow was all he would have ; ; END
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline . END
his years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline . END
he began to UNK the bottle , the rusty cap UNK on its threads . END
popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted . END
of course it was water he really UNK ; ; END
down in the UNK of the sun he was becoming dried out . END
the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack . END
matsuo shook his head . END
he had no water for an enemy . END
and when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter UNK to UNK other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool . END
he UNK the bottle and replaced it . END
after all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine . END
before much longer the marine UNK down . END
the upper part of his UNK had stained dark . END
there is nothing for you '' , matsuo said . END
`` your superiors will certainly beat you for your UNK , besides the UNK of it . END
i've nothing for you '' . END
from the UNK UNK of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping . END
he reminded matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china . END
in china it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , UNK , UNK , with the village burning about him and shells exploding . END
chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar . END
only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were . END
blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame . END
he UNK at the stranger as the distance between them closed . END
`` since when did they allow UNK kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ? END
`` seems to me i don't remember altering any law about that '' . END
he straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer . END
`` stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called . END
`` i don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when i'm UNK '' : END
the stranger ignored him . END
he didn't stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver . END
`` i'm billy tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and i've come for pat UNK body '' . END
`` and what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ? END
`` because i'm asking . END
most of the time i get what i ask for '' . END
blue throat winked at his six UNK . END
`` the kid has no manners , boys . END
shall we teach him some '' ? ? END
his gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster . END
tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and UNK the big UNK on the side of his chin . END
his head snapped round and he UNK back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling . END
tilghman UNK on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him UNK against the bar . END
a bullet UNK into the bar top an inch from tilghman's stomach as blue throat's UNK started shooting . END
tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun . END
the colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing . END
a third shot UNK the light . END
somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` you all right , billy '' ? ? END
`` yes , george , but i ain't got poor old UNK body yet . END
and i aim to have it '' . END
he fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed . END
another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor . END
`` ok , tilghman , i'm quitting '' . END
`` and me '' , said another blue throat UNK . END
somebody brought a light . END
tilghman and his partner , george rust , UNK the men into a corner . END
`` and now '' , said tilghman with deadly calm , `` i'll repeat what i said . END
i've come for pat UNK body '' . END
in two minutes the body of tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling UNK the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial . END
blue throat , nursing an aching jaw and a UNK dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight . END
`` that UNK will be back tomorrow '' , predicted george rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him . END
blue throat won't stand for this . END
he'll shoot up the town '' . END
the prediction was correct . END
the reverend james UNK had scarcely completed pat UNK last rites on boot hill in the township of UNK , when shots were heard in the distance . END
`` amen '' , said the reverend UNK , grabbing his rifle UNK up against a UNK , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' . END
billy tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle . END
blue throat , who had ruled the town with his UNK for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship . END
it was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a UNK , ruthless UNK , and this was the UNK wild west method of doing it . END
he rode in at the head of sixty UNK and UNK UNK and took over a livery barn at the entrance to main street . END
the entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn . END
any posse riding down the street to demand blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire . END
the UNK citizens of UNK had gathered inside UNK store , halfway down the street . END
several were firing into the barn when billy tilghman arrived . END
he sized up the situation and shook his head . END
`` if blue throat has his way he'll keep us all UNK up in here for days '' , he said . END
`` there's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' . END
he called the store owner and together they went into the UNK . END
billy returned with six sticks of dynamite . END
`` i'm gonna drop these into blue throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and i'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' . END
he slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and UNK into UNK . END
blue throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets UNK the store fronts and board walk as he passed . END
fifty yards away from the barn he UNK inside a UNK shop and came out at the back . END
here he couldn't be seen by blue throat and his gang . END
all he had to do was light the UNK of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and UNK the sticks through . END
billy tilghman did just that . END
within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking UNK , with every UNK either dead or injured inside . END
it was the abrupt end of blue throat's dictatorship in UNK . END
though only slightly injured himself the big UNK never returned to those parts . END
to tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of UNK , UNK adventures on the side of the law which started in UNK when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet . END
of all the UNK UNK tough boys of the old west , `` uncle billy tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders . END
he was the UNK who survived more UNK than any other famous UNK character in the book . END
he saw the most action , beat up more UNK with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the UNK than any other u.s. marshal who lived before or after him . END
for fifty years his guns and UNK fists shot holes through and battered the UNK out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west . END
the deeds of countless western UNK and UNK have been glorified almost to the point of UNK , but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his UNK career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while UNK the west have remained almost UNK . END
citizens took the view that a UNK was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century . END
he came within an ace of being UNK with bullets during his long fight with the doolin gang which UNK oklahoma in the UNK . END
led by bill doolin , these UNK specialized in train UNK but as a UNK they UNK stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . END
bill UNK ambition , it appeared , was to UNK out his name with bullets alongside those of UNK james and billy the kid , and bill tilghman had sworn he would stop him . END
tilghman knew that some ranchers were UNK with the doolin gang . END
they bought UNK cattle from the UNK , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , UNK his men in their houses . END
billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named ed dunn , who lived at rock fort . END
on a bitterly cold day in january , 1895 , accompanied only by neal brown as his deputy , tilghman left the township of UNK and headed for rock fort and UNK ranch . END
it was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside . END
the only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was UNK out thick smoke . END
the two UNK halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door . END
`` wait here , neal '' , said tilghman . END
`` if i don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' . END
leaving his rifle in the wagon , tilghman walked up to the door and UNK on it . END
there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside . END
directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day . END
seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , ed dunn . END
`` hello , ed '' , said tilghman . END
the rancher grunted an UNK but didn't move . END
tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire . END
suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a UNK UNK and caused the hairs to UNK on the back of his neck . END
along each side of the room were six UNK bunks , each one UNK off with a curtain . END
and projecting UNK through these curtains were the gleaming UNK of six rifles , all trained on billy tilghman . END
the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might UNK into his hide . END
thinking fast , tilghman never hesitated for one instant . END
he walked right up to the fire as though UNK unaware of the guns covering him . END
the men behind them were bill doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer . END
`` cold day '' , said tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his UNK to the fire . END
`` just dropped in to ask where jed UNK lives . END
can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' . END
the rancher was trembling . END
he wouldn't look tilghman in the face . END
`` follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely . END
`` UNK UNK is on the south bank '' . END
resisting the overwhelming temptation to UNK himself out of that UNK UNK , tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes . END
all that time rifle barrels were pointing UNK at his head and body . END
one false move on his part and he would be a dead man . END
`` well '' , he announced , `` guess i'll be going now , ed , and thanks for the UNK '' . END
he strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still UNK behind him . END
he left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been allowed to come out alive . END
but he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon . END
if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly . END
leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown . END
`` don't say or do anything '' , he said softly . END
`` just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry . END
that place is crawling with bill doolin and his gang '' . END
even as he spoke those words billy tilghman's life hung on a thread . END
back in the house a UNK named red buck , sore because billy had been allowed to leave UNK , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then . END
`` you'll stay right here '' , commanded bill doolin , covering red with his rifle . END
`` billy tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back . END
we'll let him go '' . END
but the fighting UNK UNK run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell , oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice UNK . END
wiley lynn , a UNK prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since . END
that night he UNK out of ma UNK dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver . END
for several months now , jack carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , UNK face and UNK UNK eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a woman . END
this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; END
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him UNK . END
when she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach . END
then he would run to the toilet behind the house . END
sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this woman was almost always with him . END
he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him . END
but they never said anything , so he figured it was all right . END
and so when miss langford came to teach at the UNK chestnut school , where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the woman of jack's mind assumed the UNK face and figure . END
he could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; END
when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do . END
when he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh . END
miss langford ( her first name was evelyn ) was an attractive girl . END
tall , blonde , UNK , fair , UNK without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of UNK UNK as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , UNK summer dress . END
something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; END
but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like jack . END
she would look at jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and jack would see the woman and become breathless and a little sick . END
school began in august , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days miss langford was very UNK with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another . END
the first two or three days they went home early . END
all , that is , except jack . END
he hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order . END
once ( this was on the third day of school ) she UNK down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg . END
he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating . END
about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him . END
he jumped back , ducked and ran , UNK , down the hill away from the school . END
he didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; END
then he slowed to a walk . END
the vision became even stronger now . END
`` i'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself . END
`` i've got to get her '' . END
that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was UNK . END
he ate UNK that morning , and his mother became concerned , UNK as he usually ate heartily . END
`` what's the matter , honey '' ? ? END
she said , with the UNK of a middle-aged woman for her only child . END
`` aren't you hungry '' ? ? END
`` no , i'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs . END
outside it was already hot at 7:30 a.m. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen . END
he felt a little sick at his stomach . END
`` are you sick '' ? ? END
`` no '' , he said . END
`` i'll be all right . END
i guess it's this hot weather '' . END
`` don't you play hard today then . END
and if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early . END
daddy left the car for me , and i'm going to town this afternoon '' . END
`` UNK , i won't play hard '' , he promised . END
just then charles lever yelled , `` hey , jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house , and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` good-bye , UNK '' over his shoulder . END
`` UNK say , boy '' ? ? END
charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth . END
charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , UNK , with straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes . END
he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him . END
`` you know what i done last night '' ? ? END
charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the UNK highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school . END
jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were charles' only apparent interest . END
but jack always derived UNK sensual UNK from charles' UNK ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now . END
`` i got margaret rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' . END
a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind . END
his heart beat faster . END
`` hell you say '' ? ? END
he said , UNK into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles . END
`` UNK you do it '' ? ? END
`` hell , i jist got on top of -- '' END
`` no , i mean UNK you get her to do it '' ? ? END
`` hell , i jist ask her '' . END
`` jist like that '' ? ? END
`` hell , yes . END
she's been UNK around me a lot here lately , and i UNK i might as UNK try it . END
besides i heard her old uncle that stays there has been UNK it '' . END
`` i never heard that '' . END
`` it's all over UNK . END
if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your UNK '' . END
`` i might try it one of these days '' , jack said UNK , thinking of miss langford . END
when they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse . END
miss langford , in a fresh white dress and UNK white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside . END
`` time for books '' , she yelled , UNK a little UNK store bell in her right hand . END
`` let's go inside '' . END
`` oh , come on miss langford , play with us just UNK '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully . END
`` no , not now '' , said the teacher . END
`` maybe at dinner time . END
come inside now '' . END
the children grudgingly stopped playing then and UNK into the schoolhouse . END
jack watched miss langford all morning . END
he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about margaret rider . END
occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret , fourteen and UNK in a fresh green UNK dress , sitting in the UNK row , and he could hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did . END
at UNK , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except charles , went off out the road to play ball . END
`` why ain't you UNK ball '' ? ? END
he asked charles suspiciously as they sat in the UNK shade , watching the girls UNK in front of the schoolhouse . END
`` miss langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called . END
`` i'd UNK stay here and watch the girls '' , charles grinned . END
`` maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' . END
`` maybe '' , jack said idly , watching for miss langford . END
presently she came out of the schoolhouse . END
when she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` UNK , UNK '' . END
`` let's play with 'em '' , jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants . END
`` o.k. '' charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls . END
they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap . END
then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls , jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled UNK , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head . END
while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` UNK , i'm sorry , miss langford . END
i didn't mean to pull so hard '' . END
`` that's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes . END
`` it was my fault '' . END
with one hand she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with the other . END
when her hand touched his , fire went through jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet . END
he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go . END
`` thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off . END
`` will you play with us again , miss langford '' ? ? END
one of the little girls said . END
`` no more today . END
maybe some other day '' . END
`` oh , UNK '' , the girl said . END
`` i don't believe i'll play any more neither '' . END
`` me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone . END
jack walked off alone out the road in the UNK midday sun , past robert UNK UNK , UNK house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes . END
when he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up . END
he simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class . END
that should do it , he thought , because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work . END
he had considered throwing UNK or UNK UNK at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand UNK in a corner instead of stay in after school . END
the only UNK now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack . END
`` but i've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately . END
to his surprise his plan worked perfectly . END
`` all right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , miss langford said firmly , not smiling . END
`` you will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' . END
and so when the others UNK out that afternoon jack remained UNK in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a UNK manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . END
he scarcely saw them . END
his heart was pounding like a mighty UNK and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` how will i do it ? ? END
on the fringe of the amused UNK of white UNK stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise . END
she UNK little UNK UNK called UNK belly and kept her green , somewhat UNK eyes fixed on a UNK male who was UNK wildly with a UNK king snake wrapped around his bronze neck . END
the youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . END
lithe and muscular , he had UNK features , and his light color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family . END
the UNK white girl turned to a distinguished , UNK man standing at her side and murmured : `` look at your watch , col. UNK . END
it is almost time for and UNK to begin '' . END
col. henri UNK was one of new orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners . END
he chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start . END
the slaves ran gaily to the center of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny UNK . END
johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the UNK which served as his drum . END
he showed his gleaming UNK of teeth and bellowed UNK , his brass UNK UNK UNK as he shook and trembled in ecstasy . END
the UNK UNK the UNK with frantic intensity as the dancers began the UNK , a sensual UNK which had long been a favorite of UNK practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds . END
the dance was of UNK origin . END
the white girl with the penetrating green eyes UNK the UNK handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had UNK skin and UNK eyebrows . END
he was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners . END
he proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , dr. louis lalaurie , who bore one of the south's oldest and most cherished names . END
delphine was a UNK in high society . END
she was a top UNK and one of the city's most gracious UNK . END
although new orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a UNK , a nymphomaniac and UNK mad -- the UNK of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on american soil . END
madame lalaurie UNK with her riding crop toward the UNK youth who was UNK and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders . END
the slender , handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by the other slaves . END
he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent UNK for women of any race . END
but dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in UNK st. john . END
shy , actually , he avoided feminine UNK and seemed truly ignorant of the UNK desires when they sought to make UNK with him in the open fields , in carriages and in UNK . END
this young slave was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie UNK that she wanted him to draw near . END
the woman eyed the youth with the UNK a coin collector might display toward a rare UNK which is not yet in his collection . END
`` what is your name , boy ? ? END
come a bit closer . END
i won't bite , you know '' . END
he UNK at madame lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which UNK from her . END
then he smiled shyly . END
`` my name is dandy brandon , UNK . END
i belong to master alexander prieur '' . END
she said with intense feeling : `` come near , let me feel your arms . END
you look quite strong and healthy to me , dandy '' . END
mrs. lalaurie impatiently UNK the slave toward her waiting carriage . END
lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm . END
the woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which UNK on the floor in a UNK . END
once inside the UNK UNK , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army UNK . END
satisfied at last , and after a few UNK UNK on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her UNK driver . END
this was the big man with the UNK air and the UNK , UNK eyebrows . END
i want you to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase . END
there's $600 in gold in this UNK sack . END
if the old fool argues about the price , tell him i shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer . END
prieur has UNK and depends on UNK pills and UNK . END
besides , he owns 300 slaves . END
one less shouldn't matter to him '' . END
UNK UNK , the UNK UNK who had been brought in chains years before from his native UNK UNK , smiled UNK and touched his UNK UNK hat . END
his bold eyes raked the woman , and a UNK spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner . END
`` another youth , madame '' ? ? END
the UNK said softly . END
`` this one is a tender chicken , UNK ? ? END
such delicate beauty , such fine flesh . END
it will rip and UNK easily for madame '' . END
`` be quiet , UNK ! ! END
you are forgetting your place '' . END
the tall UNK walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur . END
delphine lalaurie took the reins in her UNK hands and drove dandy brandon -- UNK in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at UNK UNK street . END
dr. louis lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the UNK mansion . END
dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle . END
he saw a UNK man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head . END
dr. lalaurie wore a UNK smoking jacket , and his UNK eyes were UNK and glistened behind thick UNK lenses . END
he was about 50 years old . END
`` another young man , my dear ? ? END
really , you are most UNK to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure . END
delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician UNK it like a timid UNK . END
`` dandy is to be our house guest , louis . END
i want the room in the attic prepared for him he is a most unusual lad , quite UNK in many ways . END
he deserves a better life than just UNK away on the prieur plantation '' . END
`` quite so , my dear . END
his room will be ready shortly '' . END
the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the UNK slave . END
had dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to UNK from the UNK tender care if he valued his life . END
but he liked the smell of UNK perfume . END
besides , her UNK and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth . END
also , he was weary of plantation UNK and monotony . END
so dandy brandon UNK entered the house with delphine lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home . END
UNK and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and UNK relatives in a UNK at UNK st. john . END
he bounced UNK on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when madame lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than UNK . END
it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the UNK that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell . END
when he finally left the sinister mansion on UNK street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket . END
just six weeks after dandy UNK arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his UNK young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only new orleans' oldest and UNK families were invited . END
a UNK orchestra played softly behind the UNK palms , and delphine circulated UNK among her guests , UNK UNK of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from paris , and louisiana politics . END
suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the UNK UNK and died as the musicians and guests UNK at an UNK descending the marble staircase . END
it was dandy brandon , clad only in a bloody UNK , UNK and UNK as if the devil were breathing hard on him . END
the UNK once superb body was a mass of scars and UNK . END
his pinched face showed the UNK of malnutrition . END
UNK he pointed an accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted : `` evil woman ! ! END
you did this you like to hurt to beat people i want to go home '' . END
these were the last words he ever uttered . END
UNK , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator UNK UNK , UNK the UNK shirt and UNK the politician wore . END
dr. louis lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the UNK dance floor and pronounced him dead . END
the ball broke up in confusion . END
guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie and made speedy departures . END
delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the UNK corpse . END
but at the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story . END
`` i saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry for him . END
it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest . END
after i paid monsieur prieur for dandy , i brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night . END
how he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , i cannot say . END
dr. lalaurie and i didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' . END
she UNK at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` that poor boy ! ! END
he must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced . END
UNK must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die . END
such a pitiful end '' ! ! END
though the UNK dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , UNK UNK was UNK an UNK by the jury and disregarded . END
the UNK were at the top UNK of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the UNK of so UNK a lady . END
moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in new orleans' dives . END
so the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting UNK testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold . END
once again life went its serene way -- UNK , fox UNK , balls and dinners . END
the excitement over UNK bizarre death UNK and madame UNK stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing UNK and comfort to UNK patients in the county hospital . END
then , on july 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to UNK at a furious clip . END
mrs. victor UNK , socially prominent and a neighbor of the UNK , UNK to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and UNK an amazing sight . END
the UNK UNK and his mistress , delphine lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an UNK of UNK beauty -- across the front lawn of the lalaurie mansion . END
the girl was not more than 16 . END
she was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife UNK on her back . END
the bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ; END
the UNK and delphine were gaining on her as she raced down UNK street . END
the UNK cried out in an oddly UNK voice : `` help me , somebody ! ! END
they have pulled out all my teeth and now she will UNK out my tongue with her UNK ! ! END
`` bastards '' , he would say , `` all i did was put a beat to that UNK stuff , and the first chair UNK me '' ! ! END
since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from greenwich village to the UNK , he had become a UNK UNK . END
`` there ain't nothin' faster , or UNK , or more direct than a UNK freight when you wanna go someplace '' , feathertop would say . END
`` the accommodations may not be the UNK , but man ! ! END
there ain't nobody UNK for your ticket UNK , neither '' . END
he had been UNK the UNK for a long , long time now . END
ever since the UNK , and the trouble with the quartet , and midge and the child . END
ever since all that . END
it had been a very long time that had no form and no end . END
he was -- as he told himself in the UNK of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out . END
out and out and never to return again . END
till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped . END
that was the day it ended . END
the freight car was cold , early in the morning . END
he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay UNK , the rattling and UNK of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his UNK . END
he held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato UNK neatly and sweetly as he UNK its UNK . END
the train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; END
at first UNK , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot . END
the boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor . END
she pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and UNK music UNK away . END
`` now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner . END
a little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted . END
hot , that was the word , hot ! ! END
hair like a UNK UNK wings , with the sun shining down over them . END
a poet , yet ! ! END
his thoughts for the UNK neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however . END
then the boy UNK himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting . END
he was less to see , but feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight . END
curly hair , high cheekbones , wide UNK mouth , a pair of UNK UNK hands , and a body that said well , maybe i can UNK you for ten minutes -- but then i'm finished . END
`` we made it , cappy '' , the UNK said . END
`` yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig UNK from his dirty pants . END
`` none of that . END
we run a respectable house here '' . END
they whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the UNK light from the boarded freight wall . END
he was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes . END
he held the black plastic UNK lightly . END
`` come sit '' , said feathertop , UNK them toward him . END
`` that UNK is softer over here '' . END
the girl smiled , and started forward . END
the boy yanked her back hard , UNK her off her feet , and gathered her into the UNK of his arm . END
`` now stay with me , kitty '' , he snapped UNK . END
`` i vowed to take care of you -- and that's what i'm gonna do . END
we don't know this guy '' . END
`` UNK , square bit '' , feathertop screwed his face up . END
this guy was strictly from UNK . END
`` what is with this UNK jazz '' ? ? END
feathertop inquired , lounging against the UNK UNK wall . END
`` we -- we UNK '' , cappy said . END
his head came up and he said it UNK . END
`` well , congratulations '' . END
feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand . END
these two were going to be easy UNK . END
they couldn't have much dough , but then none of the UNK feathertop rolled had much . END
and besides , the UNK had a little something the others didn't have . END
that was gonna be fun collecting ! ! END
but not just yet . END
feathertop was a UNK . END
he liked to UNK his meat before he tasted it . END
`` come sit '' , he repeated , UNK to the piled hay bags , over the pig UNK . END
`` i'm just a poor UNK man , name of -- uh -- boyd smith '' . END
he grinned at them UNK . END
`` that ain't your name , mister '' , the boy accused . END
`` and you know -- you're right '' ! ! END
feathertop aimed a finger at him . END
`` oh , come on , cappy '' , the girl UNK . END
he's a nice guy '' . END
she started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant cappy behind her . END
feathertop watched the smooth UNK of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , UNK the skirt out in a wide circle . END
he cleared his throat ; ; END
it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within UNK distance . END
he had it all UNK , of course . END
slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to philadelphia -- and then have a UNK ball with the doll . END
UNK -- UNK ! ! END
`` where'd you come from , mr. -- uh -- mr. smith '' ? ? END
`` where from '' ? ? END
i been riding train for a ways now '' . END
they UNK into silence , and the freight UNK up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and UNK to itself . END
after a while , kitty murmured something to cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` we'll just have to wait till we pull into UNK , honey '' . END
`` what's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ? END
ernie found it immensely funny . END
the boy UNK at him , and the girl looked shocked . END
certainly not , i mean , no that isn't what i said '' ! ! END
she snapped at him . END
`` i only said i was hungry . END
we haven't had anything to eat all day '' . END
UNK suffused feathertop ernie UNK voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles . END
`` UNK ya say so , fellow travelers ! ! END
why , we got dinner right here . END
c'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' . END
cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty UNK to the center of the UNK boxcar . END
ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag . END
he took out a small UNK filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and UNK folded piece of tin foil with holes in it . END
he put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot . END
`` a charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the UNK makeshift UNK . END
`` fan it '' , he told cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper . END
`` yeah , but UNK we gonna eat ? ? END
`` fella '' , ernie UNK a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my UNK patience '' . END
he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of UNK . END
`` hot dogs , man . END
not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' . END
he ripped down the UNK carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil . END
almost immediately they began to UNK . END
he looked up and grinned . END
`` a UNK UNK '' , he explained . END
`` i UNK '' . END
when they had licked the last of the UNK taste from their fingers , they settled back , and cappy offered ernie a cigarette . END
nice kid , ernie thought , too bad . END
`` how come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ? END
cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply . END
but surprisingly , kitty's face came up and she said , `` my father . END
he didn't want us to get married . END
so we ran away '' . END
`` why didn't he want you to get UNK '' ? ? END
this time even she did not answer . END
she looked down at her hands , too . END
after a few seconds , she said , `` dad didn't like cappy . END
it was my fault '' . END
UNK head came around sharply . END
`` your fault , hell ! ! END
it was all my fault . END
if i'd been careful it never UNK '' -- he stopped abruptly . END
UNK eyebrows went up . END
`` what's the matter '' ? ? END
the girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` i'm pregnant '' . END
cappy raged at himself . END
`` oh he was stupid , her old man ! ! END
you never heard nothin' like it : kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and kitty's this and kitty's that like he was nuts or UNK , UNK '' ? ? END
this was a slightly different matter . END
he remembered midge , and the child . END
but that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about . END
a time before the white lightning and the UNK had turned him inside out . END
but these kids weren't like him . END
he thought , pull out of it , old son . END
these are just another couple of characters to roll . END
what they got , you get . END
now forget all this other . END
`` wanna drink '' ? ? END
ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket . END
now that you offer '' . END
the answer came from the open door of the boxcar . END
from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade . END
ernie stared at the man . END
real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a UNK . END
road gang , ernie thought . END
`` you gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ? END
the big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar . END
ernie hesitated a moment . END
this character could break him in half . END
`` sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips . END
he UNK down three-quarters of the strong UNK and UNK the remainder . END
the man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring . END
he took the bottle with undue UNK , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely . END
he threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched UNK . END
he belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door . END
`` well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket . END
`` i didn't know i was gonna have company in this car '' . END
`` we're going to philadelphia '' , kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more . END
`` no , i don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final UNK for ernie . END
he had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it . END
`` maybe you and me will , UNK , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' . END
he advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car . END
ernie was screaming inside himself : no , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! ! END
the newcomer stalked toward them , and kitty UNK back , her hand to her mouth . END
her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard . END
the kid hit the bigger man with an audible UNK ! ! END
and carried him backward in a UNK tackle . END
they went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but UNK arms and legs . END
the kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back . END
the fist went down into the pile of flesh , and ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` UNK '' ! ! END
then they were UNK again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious UNK . END
he held the knife UNK an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud . END
the blade came out with a UNK ! ! END
he UNK the knife UNK , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat . END
kitty screamed UNK and her face was white . END
she grabbed at UNK sleeve and shrieked , `` help him ! ! END
do something '' ! ! END
they neither liked nor disliked the old man . END
to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , UNK , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets . END
the old man was unimportant . END
yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june ; ; END
or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and UNK -- rising up from aluminum UNK wrapped in UNK UNK . END
or the UNK whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the UNK street lights . END
or the bay of female dogs in heat . END
they never called him by name , although he had one . END
UNK UNK , that's what he was called in the old country ; ; END
but here he was just UNK or the old man . END
but this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders . END
youth obeyed when commanded . END
it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession . END
but youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing . END
the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened . END
but the past was dead here as the present was dead . END
once the old man had had a wife . END
and once she , too , ignored him . END
with a tiny UNK wrapped around her shoulders , she UNK her UNK UNK down the street before him and didn't stop . END
in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase . END
the way she UNK down the street , the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both . END
without looking at him , without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange UNK , rode away in it , and never came back . END
`` but she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said . END
`` no , no . END
she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from UNK '' . END
`` eh , UNK ! ! END
she gave herself fancy UNK ! ! END
just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' . END
they had slapped their thighs . END
`` it's not for making pretty speeches about UNK those UNK get paid so good '' . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
UNK fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished UNK , had swayed excitedly beneath UNK UNK where tiny black hairs UNK , never to be UNK away . END
UNK mouths that had never known anything UNK than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
but if the old man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a UNK . END
it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the UNK UNK of a woman he had consumed -- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner . END
his voice had not commanded her to stop . END
it had not questioned why . END
the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ; END
but he might have been UNK away the UNK that hopped from his yellow dog onto him . END
( he was never without that dog . END
) and his eyes -- those miniature UNK of UNK yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction . END
the old man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it . END
perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife . END
but when he called for his UNK , wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? ? END
there seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him . END
for all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in italy , not the UNK of philadelphia . END
it could have been bari or UNK for the way it smelled . END
what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals ? ? END
or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill ? ? END
this place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his UNK . END
to him they were one and the same . END
sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of UNK trees which divided these quarters from the city . END
sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash . END
it slashed the sloping UNK lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden UNK . END
it swayed with the wicker UNK and UNK with the UNK hinges of screen doors . END
even the UNK , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it . END
and the coffee shop on drexel street , where the men spent their evenings and sundays playing cards , had a rose UNK beneath its window . END
the UNK UNK of coffee dregs thrown against it . END
only one house on the street had no lawn before it . END
it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron UNK supporting a glass facade . END
that was UNK shop . END
above it , from a UNK UNK , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood . END
did the old man remember them there ? ? END
yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks -- like UNK perched against the UNK of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery . END
only paved UNK UNK through the walls of those UNK into the mysterious core of UNK behind the houses where UNK owned no fences , where one man's property blended with the next to form UNK in which no one knew privacy . END
love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by UNK trees and UNK vines . END
and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch . END
the old man silently fed upon these streets . END
they kept him alive , waiting . END
waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . END
it was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price . END
he was holding out for something . END
he was determined to hold out . END
the old man's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich . END
at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ; END
neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him . END
he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn't have cared less about that either . END
to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep . END
when he would be a man , he would be a rich man . END
he would not be like the `` rich americans '' who lived in UNK houses on the other side of the park . END
he would not ride the UNK local to the city each morning . END
he would not carry a brief case . END
nor would he work at all . END
he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step . END
he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a UNK fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , UNK with her running , calling out in her UNK , `` at your service '' . END
he would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his gloves -- and light and smoke . END
he could do that when he would be a man . END
`` hey , laura '' ! ! END
he called to his sister on the porch above the steps . END
she was only ten months older than he . END
`` laura , what would you say if i smoked a pipe '' ? ? END
laura did not answer him . END
she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , UNK hair in the sun . END
one lithe leg UNK the UNK and swung loosely before the creaking , torn UNK . END
her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward UNK toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white . END
all the while she sat there , her UNK arms swirled before her chest . END
her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii . END
it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a UNK that UNK the lyric lines of its contours . END
the eyes , blue and always somewhat UNK , possessed a sullen quality . END
even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance . END
he was never sure they fully took him in . END
pompeii called again , `` laura '' ! ! END
but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it . END
`` she's in a mood '' , he thought `` there's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood '' . END
well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ? END
and as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him . END
suddenly he was interrupted in his UNK by a warm UNK UNK against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a UNK claret tongue , UNK against the salt taste of him . END
above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , UNK and UNK , UNK within a sphere of UNK pink skin , stared UNK at him . END
`` christ sake , goat , git '' ! ! END
but the goat would not . END
`` you're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ? END
soothing it with his hand , knowing the UNK jowls and the swollen smoothness of UNK that wrinkled UNK to his touch . END
his head UNK gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those UNK . END
with his mouth opened wide , he UNK the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue UNK the light , earthy taste of it . END
the boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a UNK player , pressing and pulling , UNK in what he did . END
above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud . END
its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering UNK . END
but the boy could see only the UNK belly . END
the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something UNK in it . END
he knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow UNK back . END
there would be time enough , perhaps the old man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due . END
time enough to give up his soul . END
in the meantime , six sandals , stained an UNK , the same color as UNK shaved hair , edged up close to him . END
the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for UNK . END
he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to UNK , the UNK ones to UNK , and the UNK ones to UNK , UNK UNK brother . END
pompeii expected UNK small body to sink closer and closer to the ground . END
he expected UNK thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , UNK voice to sound against the UNK of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything . END
people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it . END
the room filled with smoke , and UNK head UNK with excitement and fatigue , but stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to UNK it . END
little anne rapidly UNK her mother in recovery . END
in two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a UNK of UNK hair all over her head . END
she stopped flying into UNK and started UNK her food ; ; END
she developed a UNK and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . END
she was so heavy that UNK arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . END
maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be UNK through the UNK old UNK and lugged out and lugged back ; ; END
there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating . END
worry had a great deal to do with it ; ; END
stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him . END
mr. UNK would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap . END
maggie and stuart UNK over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more . END
in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon : `` do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money , so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? ? END
`` it seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , eugenia said . END
she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again . END
`` i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something '' , maggie said . END
`` it would make me feel a lot better , but the woman's exchange isn't taking baked goods any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery '' . END
`` i should think so '' , eugenia said . END
`` for one thing you can stop keeping that child in UNK dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day '' . END
`` she's so beautiful , and i do like to keep her looking nice '' . END
she picked up the baby and UNK her fat warm little neck . END
`` she'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be UNK '' , eugenia said . END
`` UNK mae evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel UNK until it was nine months old '' . END
`` UNK mae evans got all her baby clothes from UNK UNK bazaar in new york , and i'm sick and tired of hearing about UNK mae evans '' . END
`` well now , maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , eugenia said . END
`` i'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' . END
i do seem to snap at everybody these days , but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' . END
`` well , let's see . END
let's make a list of your assets '' . END
maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining . END
when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope UNK down words and figures . END
`` i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , eugenia said . END
`` we could put up UNK on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a UNK where it's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that '' . END
`` what else '' ? ? END
`` you might set up a dress shop in the living room '' . END
`` every woman in the block has tried that '' . END
`` what about a tea room , then ? ? END
you could set up tables in the front room and serve UNK and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes '' . END
`` it's too elaborate . END
and grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am i '' . END
she said , `` well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' . END
`` oh , i'm sure i could do that '' , maggie said . END
`` but it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' . END
`` don't worry , i can get plenty more '' , eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could . END
maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it . END
`` and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time . END
and i can go back to my contests and be thinking while i'm doing the washing '' . END
`` what are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything '' ? ? END
she said , `` oh eugenia , i wish '' END
`` what '' ? ? END
`` i wish i had three wishes '' , maggie said . END
`` all of them for you '' . END
it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november , contributing to the UNK of countless numbers of people . END
the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days . END
the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city , locking it in an icy grip that UNK its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ; END
it had a look of grim stark realism , UNK other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling UNK UNK greedy western city UNK in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless UNK and resources . END
the UNK huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies . END
there weren't facilities to take care of them ; ; END
there never had been a need felt for such facilities . END
that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east , which created UNK with their stock markets and their UNK populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by UNK freight rates . END
the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; END
and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay . END
the government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything . END
shivering , people talked and argued ; ; END
all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done . END
something had to be done ; ; END
it was the theme song of millions of american people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government . END
something had to be done . END
the UNK said it to each other a dozen times a day . END
something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for UNK , for clothes , for the new UNK in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; END
about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day . END
just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster . END
the UNK furnace consumed fuel like a giant UNK UNK that had to be UNK by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold . END
cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping UNK , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof . END
presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the UNK and an electric heater in UNK room . END
it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people UNK or UNK or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor UNK fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive . END
the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they UNK the UNK . END
they lived mainly in the kitchen ; ; END
they moved UNK bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them UNK by the stove and ran UNK and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds . END
grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to . END
`` you said a UNK '' , eugenia said grimly . END
eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin . END
she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to UNK in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever . END
`` plenty of people are poor all their lives '' . END
`` plenty of people haven't our brains and talent '' . END
`` i know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , maggie said . END
`` you're working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the UNK family is superior to everything , even a depression '' . END
`` the only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it '' , eugenia said . END
they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of UNK than it would have to be that way . END
she didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that hope have the heater . END
hope wouldn't hear of it , and she took the heater back to UNK room , and grandma took it back to UNK room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her UNK on fire . END
she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it . END
eugenia suspected her of deliberately UNK the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but hope said if grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so grandma had to give in . END
`` UNK of her to use it up . END
unusual in a case like this , but '' -- END
`` you can joke ! ! END
didn't you read it ? ? END
she's married that tenant ! ! END
`` i read it , yes . END
this ought to simplify UNK life '' . END
laban had more to say . END
tolley had gone to live in california . END
he'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny had UNK him for roy robards . END
`` it was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it , mamma . END
zion stayed to get my pin , but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back '' . END
`` we will both go back , laban '' ! ! END
kizzie turned to go inside . END
`` let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , mamma . END
the sun's right '' -- END
`` pictures '' ? ? END
`` what pictures '' ? ? END
`` in UNK room ! ! END
you told me to bring my camera . END
i'm not going back '' -- END
`` indeed you are ! ! END
why should i want pictures of an empty room now ? ? END
tolley had no idea of UNK that UNK little jenny ! ! END
this -- trip of his had nothing to do with her UNK with tenants , and i am going to see that everybody at mt. pleasant understands that simple fact . END
wait for me , laban , i'll be dressed in half a second '' ! ! END
frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back . END
`` hurry , frank ! ! END
they're not going to laugh at the UNK and UNK very long ! ! END
UNK going is my fault . END
i drove him away . END
you know it and i'll tell everybody exactly how it happened '' . END
she was so beautiful , so UNK , so UNK . END
`` make your confession to god , kizzie dear , not to the congregation '' . END
`` i'll decide that when i get there . END
i was so cruel to tolley , so unfair . END
but i'll be fair now ! ! END
he is coming back , isn't he , frank '' ? ? END
yes , oh yes . END
what else was there to say ? ? END
returning to the UNK he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips : END
`` under the window in stormy weather END
i marry this man and woman together . END
let none but him who rules the thunder END
put this man and woman UNK '' . END
UNK for his lie ? ? END
he questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its UNK , wondering why he had preserved it . END
if he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it . END
in any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a UNK peculiarly his own . END
it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing . END
`` you've told god , frank '' , he said . END
`` why UNK the -- congregation '' ? ? END
reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little UNK to flame , watching it UNK , the red sealing wax melting and UNK in the UNK ash . END
surely now his beloved son could rest in peace . END
`` ' and let me go , for the night UNK me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' '' . END
a beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , UNK , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did . END
but there were great satisfactions , even for a small man . END
beyond his window were the UNK trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life . END
there lay grand UNK quinzaine , his own young parents' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , UNK . END
he poured his UNK of wine for the toast he'd made so often . END
`` to absent loved ones '' . END
but this last time he drank not to brace but `` to tolley '' ! ! END
mr. robards -- jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt. pleasant neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too UNK . END
it didn't bother him for everybody from the UNK to the preacher to say , `` UNK , miss jenny '' , adding a careless `` roy '' , but it did her . END
he could put a stop to it , she told him again and again . END
simply call mr. UNK oscar , and dr. dunne UNK , and UNK major frank . END
mr. robards laughed , said he'd feel a damn fool , UNK couldn't do that even to please her . END
`` you could try . END
and if i ever hear you say ' mist laban ' again i'll scream . END
and don't tell me you didn't at church sunday . END
i heard you '' ! ! END
he really hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr. robards . END
how strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and UNK blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways . END
another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of UNK . END
her horse , rather . END
but mr. UNK now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! ! END
he called her `` the mare '' much as mrs. UNK spoke of `` the queen , god bless her '' . END
he , with fifteen or twenty horses or UNK or UNK or UNK out there in the barn , was UNK only of `` the mare '' , `` the UNK mare '' , the UNK gunny . END
for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp UNK around in her stall . END
and what had happened ? ? END
gunny invariably tried to bite her . END
nerves , mr. robards said , just a UNK anyway . END
`` stand back , miss jen , she's UNK of your scarf '' . END
never , `` quit that , you UNK devil '' ! ! END
never concern for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in january . END
she UNK UNK gunny whose UNK was due then too ! ! END
listening for hours to his UNK that the war and `` mist UNK '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his UNK of greatness for the procession of UNK to come , jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it . END
gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- tolley , the indifference with which the UNK and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach . END
human birth was no novelty to mr. robards . END
UNK was a fine UNK and could get here quick , he suggested . END
UNK UNK to having dr. dunne , a former UNK , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her . END
the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure . END
he would be in the barn , or riding for the UNK ! ! END
night after night he stayed with gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with UNK of expensive UNK , UNK over her UNK UNK as the cook did over charlotte UNK , UNK manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house . END
yet when the dear baby came , he had UNK over here in a UNK , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been . END
jenny wished now that she had had dr. dunne , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into UNK . END
there was something not nice about UNK , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` you don't see UNK UNK down the pike UNK day , miss jen , UNK . END
UNK 'em up cute -- UNK , UNK '' END
UNK for her mother , she said firmly , UNK , for herself , and -- END
`` UNK , for miss kizzie '' , he suggested . END
`` she was mighty good to you past times , an' UNK fetch her '' . END
now she must be thinking of a UNK , something special . END
just wait till she saw the UNK UNK . END
UNK colt in all kentucky . END
strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old . END
what about royal robards ? ? END
`` why don't you name him jesus christ ! ! END
'' she burst into tears . END
roy was deeply distressed . END
he'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet UNK had been . END
of course she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it . END
he had a good idea why not . END
those elegant `` at home '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , hadn't brought many UNK in two whole months . END
doc dunne and miss UNK had come . END
so had miss UNK UNK , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in UNK weather , was looking forward to quinzaine UNK this summer . END
there was an idea . END
miss kizzie had been right UNK ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a UNK would have brought her round . END
oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver UNK rings for all of the trips . END
but when miss jen went over right away to return the call , miss UNK couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there . END
more and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to UNK and nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and UNK under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a UNK over the babies dressed like UNK . END
though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too . END
it made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea miss UNK had given him , to be told by miss UNK that her holy UNK was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain mrs. robards and the children . END
she hoped they were well . END
he didn't tell miss jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those quinzaine UNK , and she really took a fit . END
if he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame . END
`` have a party an' leave 'em out , UNK '' , he suggested . END
`` a swell party , send an invite to UNK but them -- those folks you met at the UNK house , the ones i've got to know in this new jockey club affair , the whole UNK neighborhood . END
we'll have UNK -- couple UNK UNK fetch in a crowd any time . END
i'll see word gets round '' . END
`` don't you dare ! ! END
miss jen was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and UNK up . END
he was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try . END
zion was surprised when UNK buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that UNK UNK had had a call to preach in some mountain town . END
roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to UNK in , and he'd give her a lift to quinzaine . END
her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were getting on . END
`` see for yourself , miss zion . END
it won't take a minute '' . END
he swung in through his own wide UNK . END
`` UNK the UNK UNK you ever did see , but miss jen gets mighty UNK . END
she'll relish the sight of a friendly face . END
miss UNK won't care your UNK , will she '' ? ? END
`` why of course not '' , zion said UNK . END
`` he must have forgiven me '' , henrietta murmured to the room . END
the UNK of doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; ; END
doaty would never have left her house to a UNK woman . END
she found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best UNK pin . END
perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel . END
henrietta thought , it's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us . END
there had been more to know about UNK , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable . END
adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted . END
their childhood would have been quite UNK without UNK flair for drama , especially through the long summers . END
in winter , in the city , there had been the UNK school , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; ; END
there had been lessons in french from a small polish UNK with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ; END
there had been the dancing class -- miss UNK , thin and tireless , with her UNK UNK and her everlasting UNK , UNK . END
there had been supper parties and UNK , UNK and little balls , mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the UNK planets revolved . END
mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of charles . END
it was safe to assume that papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` thank god your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta to leave , with her hand in charles' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know . END
mama was vulnerable ; ; END
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her . END
but i would have gone anyway , thought henrietta . END
she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice . END
only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her . END
perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice . END
she turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive . END
if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles , would she have run away with him ? ? END
impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone . END
no temptation , no sin . END
no temptation , no virtue ? ? END
a curious thought to end a curious night . END
the birds were really awake now in a UNK of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf . END
before anything else , she would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten garden . END
everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided UNK . END
she closed her eyes , remembering the small french cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . END
it had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . END
after the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window . END
the garden below was lacy with UNK and enchanting in its small UNK . END
leaning out , she could see a tangle of UNK and UNK , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it . END
on a thrusting spray thick with UNK and UNK and swelling pink buds , like a summer UNK , a bird balanced and sang , UNK brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . END
it was so pretty and UNK that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but UNK UNK UNK certain age . END
feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . END
rosa , UNK , was not yet up and about , reassurance that rosa was human . END
feeling protective toward this sleeping being , henrietta found a yesterday UNK and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot . END
outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a UNK bouquet of UNK , sweet william , scented stock and lady's UNK , which she tied with long UNK and took back to show rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and UNK folly . END
the UNK came UNK to henrietta and begged for the flowers , UNK the air with UNK UNK . END
henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty . END
`` UNK in the UNK '' , said rosa coldly . END
`` go change your shoes before you turn around '' . END
she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home . END
folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door . END
to a UNK , there was only one church . END
the cemetery UNK just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea . END
for the first time in thirty years , henrietta walked down the narrow street with its UNK shops just stirring and its inhabitants UNK her with the UNK curiosity . END
she smiled and bowed , recalling the UNK feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child . END
now , some of the UNK were cautious , but all were interested . END
an old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the UNK still plainly rising in his branches . END
on an impulse , she turned back and said good morning . END
he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a UNK way that he had heard her the first time . END
he then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was UNK . END
`` summer's been slow to come '' , he said . END
`` it's my UNK out time '' . END
he UNK at her flowers . END
`` i'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality . END
`` they'll be UNK me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so UNK they plan . END
see half of 'em in their graves before i choose my own coffin . END
it's UNK myself out that does it '' . END
he regarded her with rising hope . END
`` you'd like to hear how i go about it '' . END
`` it's nice of you '' , henrietta said UNK . END
`` UNK welcome '' . END
he straightened himself , UNK against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots . END
his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a UNK for emphasizing the UNK aspects of his text . END
`` every month , UNK three days '' , he said happily , `` i take no water into my system , no water whatsoever . END
it rests the tissues '' . END
henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her UNK good sense . END
`` rests the tissues '' , he said , `` and UNK the system . END
my dad did it , and he lived to a great age '' . END
he looked up at her sharply . END
`` don't remember , do you '' ? ? END
she did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old UNK , who must have been in his UNK when henrietta ran away . END
next to the UNK , UNK had owned the island most , and she and adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very UNK blue eyes like a UNK , more aged than possible . END
he had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a UNK captain and powerful like the sea . END
it must be that son who sat before her now , UNK to half his size and half his senses . END
she said gently , `` of course i remember you '' . END
`` not so UNK i remember you '' , he said . END
`` UNK the young UNK woman . END
ran away on a black night with a UNK wedded man . END
i know all about you '' . END
`` you do seem to '' , said henrietta , impressed . END
`` can't blame a man for UNK his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully . END
`` left mine many a time , only she never knew it . END
man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit . END
any harm in that '' ? ? END
`` probably '' , said henrietta dryly . END
he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly . END
`` you'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws . END
only , this old man's UNK was even less to her taste than UNK UNK open UNK . END
well , she had not come back to great island to be understood , praised or condemned . END
she had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow . END
she started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a UNK , UNK figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress . END
she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man . END
`` you've not had your breakfast yet , UNK '' . END
`` UNK UNK UNK is no breakfast '' , he said . END
`` milk and UNK '' ! ! END
he beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his UNK and clattered on the stones . END
`` he's UNK today '' , his UNK said wearily , and bent to pick it up . END
`` he's got this idea about drying out '' END
`` it ain't an idea '' ! ! END
`` if it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? ? END
he looked UNK to heaven and said , `` beer don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she UNK him his stint of UNK . END
`` come on , do . END
the children are eating , and miss UNK on her way UNK '' . END
`` to the graveyard . END
who ain't '' ? ? END
i've got a day's work to do . END
-- you'll be visiting miss doaty , ma'am '' ? ? END
how much they knew about her ! ! END
the woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when UNK and UNK had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own . END
`` god rest her soul , she was a sweet one . END
come on now '' . END
she put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old . END
he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , UNK UNK to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was UNK about by those who still had their wicked strength . END
there was a UNK of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of UNK from the old man . END
henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their UNK way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , folly dancing ahead of her . END
at the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , UNK with fat round bushes like sheep . END
they were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots UNK at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry . END
the air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky . END
she felt UNK , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty . END
both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the UNK had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` UNK UNK '' seemed suddenly impossible . END
she sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with UNK , her fingers tracing the UNK carved letters padded with green moss . END
the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her UNK , if only to shade doaty's flowers . END
a small , UNK angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery . END
she remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and UNK clouds when she and adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts . END
the UNK family had come from UNK UNK , in the northeast of the main japanese island of UNK , where there are still traces of the mysterious UNK strain . END
the UNK were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the japanese came from southern asia . END
apparently they were of UNK blood . END
they had white skins and blue eyes ; ; END
all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful . END
a pitiful few of them are left now , to UNK mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal UNK , which have the same haunting sadness as the UNK of the american indians . END
most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in UNK or UNK UNK is much more hairy than the average japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny UNK UNK of the invaders from the south . END
tommy UNK was one of these fortunate occasions . END
she was taller than most japanese girls , and had the UNK UNK form of the japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall . END
her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her UNK had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong . END
her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about . END
she had black eyes , long and UNK tilted , and the way she walked was melody . END
she had been in japan just one week . END
it was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; END
she was already considering putting in UNK requests for duty at san diego , UNK , the great lakes , pensacola -- any place the navy had a hospital -- with a threat to UNK her commission if the request were not granted . END
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors . END
there was nothing wrong with her job . END
tommy had been assigned to the UNK ward . END
there were no UNK serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes UNK up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor -- sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high . END
at present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the UNK of UNK sunk too close UNK , because the work involved setting off UNK blasts at all hours . END
tommy was interested in UNK , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients . END
but she suffered in her UNK hours . END
such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the officers' club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until UNK . END
she had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck . END
this was one of the navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world . END
ships from the west coast rotated on UNK tours of duty with the seventh fleet , and UNK was the seventh UNK principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty . END
sooner or later , all the gray navy ships came in here ; ; END
if tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach . END
and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there . END
she felt , rather than saw , the approach of the good-looking young man . END
he came through from the fleet bar , which was stag , with the ice cubes UNK in a glass he carried . END
when he saw tommy sitting alone , the UNK sound stopped . END
he was perhaps a trifle UNK , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ; END
he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant . END
probably off one of the carriers -- an UNK . END
there was a UNK chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different . END
japan did something to a man -- and it wasn't just japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas . END
it was as if foreign duty implied and UNK license ; ; END
it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? ? END
then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different . END
`` UNK , UNK '' ! ! END
he said , turning on what was meant to be charm . END
`` you UNK UNK ? ? END
maybe you UNK date with me '' ? ? END
`` i beg your pardon '' ! ! END
tommy said out of her cold rage . END
`` i don't believe i know you , and i can't understand your quaint brand of english -- it was meant to be english , wasn't it '' ? ? END
the UNK young officer fell back on his heels , UNK and blushing . END
at least , he had the decency to UNK , she thought . END
`` oh -- i'm sorry ! ! END
you see , i thought -- i mean i really had no idea '' -- END
`` oh , yes -- you had ideas '' ! ! END
`` all wrong ones '' ! ! END
then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture , and dropped into navy UNK . END
`` take off , UNK '' ! ! END
`` uh -- sorry '' ! ! END
he muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool . END
the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy . END
she felt like a fool , too . END
it hadn't been this way in college , or in UNK training ; ; END
it wasn't this way in the hospital at san diego . END
everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl . END
nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't american . END
there are spanish girls who look like tommy UNK , UNK with a UNK hint of the orient in their faces ; ; END
there are beauties from the UNK states who are similarly endowed , and -- back in the blessed united states -- they were regarded simply as pretty women . END
now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , tommy was being UNK at every turn . END
she looked around , UNK . END
four little japanese UNK were UNK the english language at the counter -- UNK UNK happened to be one of them . END
everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` UNK '' ! ! END
for a steak sandwich , or `` UNK UNK '' ! ! END
for one cup of coffee . END
two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed . END
one was with a UNK and UNK lieutenant commander ; ; END
the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children . END
seeing these did nothing for UNK mood . END
she told herself UNK , and with pride , i am an american ! ! END
and so she was , and would remain . END
but she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the club , there would always be UNK young men who would approach her with broken english . END
there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese . END
tommy wouldn't know ; ; END
after coming to america , her parents had spoken only english . END
one thing was becoming increasingly sure . END
she had been sent to the wrong place for duty . END
there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward . END
one had to have friends , and a congenial life in UNK hours . END
now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar . END
it was terribly off key , and poorly done , and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt UNK and UNK . END
she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ; END
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated . END
eating while angry had given her a slight UNK . END
back in her living quarters at the hospital she took UNK of UNK , and UNK . END
then , after a while , she went to her mirror . END
it was all true . END
she certainly looked japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men . END
and , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach . END
there was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful . END
she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of UNK -- which was not very far from UNK . END
and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the UNK her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown . END
tommy , of course , had never heard of a UNK , or japanese proverb , which says , `` UNK UNK UNK '' , and is literally translated as `` relatives are better than strangers '' . END
actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water . END
doc UNK scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline UNK there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report . END
but the beer hall riot in UNK had been unusual , too , and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in UNK rousing . END
just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know . END
in his opinion , doc had not grown up . END
the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief . END
there had never been a good reason for doc UNK to grow up . END
he had come into the navy too young , with the image of the UNK guns UNK before him . END
the war found him much too early , and its UNK -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in UNK and elaborate practical jokes , and even now doc had never found any stabilizing , UNK influence . END
he remained young at heart , with an UNK sense of humor . END
he UNK about the captain's UNK of new men , took great delight in UNK UNK with ethyl chloride , and gave no thought for tomorrow . END
he was doing thirty years , and the navy would take care of him . END
the job security enjoyed by doc UNK , and nearly all members of the armed forces , is a wonderful thing . END
actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by . END
he may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired . END
doc had been under restriction to the ship since the UNK left UNK . END
this deprived him of liberty in hong kong , but he told boats UNK that hong kong was a book he had read before , and the navy would always bring him there again , some day . END
at UNK he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry , being thoughtful , knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base . END
this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well . END
there were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base , and visit an old UNK . END
a telephone line had been hooked up to UNK the ship with the base exchange . END
after supper , doc called whitey UNK , who was now a lieutenant and had a family . END
`` well , doc , you old sonofabitch '' ! ! END
whitey exclaimed , with true affection . END
`` come over and have a drink . END
we live down by the base UNK . END
grab a taxi '' . END
`` i'll be there , but i'll walk '' , doc said . END
`` i've got to run an errand on the way . END
see you in about an hour '' . END
he threw a smart UNK at the UNK , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the petty officers' club . END
how , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? ? END
he considered some interesting UNK but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk . END
then there was exercise , boating and UNK , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted . END
perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years . END
there was swimming over at the riverside hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a UNK . END
perhaps a packing trip into the UNK , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark . END
i could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? ? END
`` you missed it '' , UNK voice said , `` you should have gone over to the pagan room with us . END
UNK , but UNK , and UNK williams and her UNK band '' . END
`` hi , buzz '' , owen said . END
`` i went over to the UNK and dropped two notes '' . END
`` tough '' , buzz said , `` listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday . END
imagine a stag dinner with UNK williams '' . END
he laughed and laughed . END
owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to reno for stag dinners . END
`` thanks '' , owen said , `` but friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' . END
buzz was a tireless UNK who never let his victims rest . END
when owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid UNK at the door . END
`` yes '' , owen called out . END
`` yes '' ? ? END
`` i'm mrs. gertrude parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` and i'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please '' . END
UNK , he thought , a lush UNK at last . END
probably saw me in the lobby . END
he was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door . END
she frowned at his green UNK with the yellow UNK . END
`` how do you do '' ? ? END
she said , UNK . END
`` our church is UNK a group of very courageous women up in alaska . END
we call them lay-sisters and they go among the UNK making friends and bringing the light . END
they're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' . END
`` oh '' ? ? END
`` you see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses UNK UNK in the bright light , `` you and i can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo '' . END
`` why is that '' ? ? END
she apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction . END
smug , owen thought , smug and UNK . END
there was a slight nervous UNK in the region of her left eye . END
it gave her a UNK , winking effect . END
`` have you ever tried to reason with an UNK '' ? ? END
she asked , winking wildly . END
`` they are a very difficult group of people '' . END
`` i don't know much about them '' , owen admitted , `` but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' . END
she smiled in a UNK fashion . END
`` you know , that's very interesting . END
people don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that . END
the more UNK i do , the more i note how far most people are from their personal god '' . END
UNK , owen kept his peace . END
what would happen next ? ? END
that she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ? END
several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice . END
`` how did you get by the desk '' ? ? END
`` i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the UNK , knocking on UNK doors and talking down UNK '' . END
`` oh , i just come once a week . END
every day i visit a different hotel . END
i feel it's my duty . END
i do this work all on my own , because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these lay-sisters . END
do you know these women go all through alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? ? END
they travel in pairs as much as a UNK miles a day '' . END
`` do you have any idea how far i travel every day ? ? END
i have the whole pacific northwest '' . END
owen was aware he was getting UNK but he couldn't help himself . END
mrs. gertrude parker drew back . END
`` that's hardly a christian approach '' , she UNK . END
`` you're in the secular world '' . END
`` i didn't say it was christian . END
i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen . END
not that religion isn't big business ; ; END
those UNK and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don't get top personnel . END
our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' . END
`` god , i take it , plays no part in this '' , she said UNK . END
`` god doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics '' , he said UNK before he caught himself . END
it sounded silly ; ; END
why go on ? ? END
more people were passing ; ; END
he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation . END
`` and whiskey '' , she said , smiling and UNK at the highball glasses . END
`` don't forget whiskey ; ; END
it's such a big seller '' . END
`` you know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` i think you're going to have to excuse me . END
i have an appointment '' . END
`` i can imagine '' , she said . END
`` probably down at the bar . END
but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? ? END
they must be freezing up there now . END
can't you help them '' ? ? END
`` leave a card or something . END
i'll think it over '' . END
`` i have no card '' , she said bitterly . END
`` you haven't been listening to what i've been telling you . END
i only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual UNK '' . END
she looked UNK , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race . END
she stood UNK for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; END
he heard her knocking on another door . END
it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; END
then he realized he was hungry . END
he showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast . END
on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail . END
there was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued . END
his lawyer had sent him a statement on his UNK UNK , and there was a letter from the collector of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's UNK . END
he ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto virginia street , he felt braced . END
he looked off to the crest of the UNK , still UNK ; ; END
the glisten of the UNK river made a wide UNK . END
he felt suddenly UNK , adventurous . END
with any luck at all he could easily find a UNK . END
although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the golden calf . END
the tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded . END
just to test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars . END
the way was opening up ; ; END
when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach . END
the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon . END
there were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a UNK . END
they all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up . END
the UNK around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers . END
the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful . END
all , of course , except the UNK party who were bent on starving to death . END
`` i wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , owen UNK . END
he sat down next to a UNK blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes . END
she sighed a dirty word and left . END
owen was surprised to see mrs. gertrude parker playing the UNK UNK that were UNK arranged by the entrance . END
she sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if UNK by mechanical devices , and owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support . END
a UNK cowboy sat down next to him in the UNK place . END
he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the UNK . END
`` what you need is a steady UNK '' , the cowboy announced after watching owen play . END
`` you can't build on your UNK UNK '' . END
`` what are you playing '' ? ? END
`` i'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained . END
`` i keep all these plays in this little black book , and i watch over a UNK period to find out what numbers are repeating . END
but UNK not my game . END
i'm always trying to find a breaking table in UNK . END
incidentally , i'm pretty famous in these parts : i'm called the wrangler '' . END
`` nice to know you . END
don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? ? END
`` well , of course i do . END
i'm with the UNK , pushing a horse called UNK . END
he's my own horse , and what i collect from him i use on UNK . END
this UNK can rack and UNK and he's the fastest thing in UNK county . END
i figure if i can get any kind of publicity campaign going , i'll land him on tv -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some western hero . END
i once trained a horse for hoot gibson , but nothing like UNK . END
he's a UNK and he photographs wonderfully '' . END
five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars . END
this proved conclusively that the wrangler was a UNK , so he walked on down to UNK , an even more glorified gambling UNK than the golden calf . END
when he looked in the back , mrs. gertrude parker was marking UNK cards . END
his adventurous spirit had UNK ; ; END
he studied the pistol exhibition that UNK featured as an added attraction . END
he UNK a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a UNK with her money in front of her . END
he had no great prejudice against UNK ; ; END
it just seemed such a dry run . END
there was no cash around ; ; END
everyone was UNK silver dollars . END
the management UNK withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers UNK or checks or premium points . END
he read a special announcement whereby UNK would feature a special UNK at three a.m. UNK UNK ( the body ) brenner and fourteen glamorous UNK . END
he wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him . END
he passed two UNK , both wearing UNK , and they made him feel a little sad . END
owen found buzz watching UNK . END
buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some UNK oil and dark glasses . END
he was shorter and UNK than owen , who felt good standing next to him . END
`` we're all going over to lake tahoe and try our luck at UNK '' , buzz explained , still UNK . END
`` we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees we can beat the wheel . END
he started out as a UNK , then became a pit boss until the club found him UNK . END
he was knocking down checks at faro '' . END
`` i'm UNK to tahoe '' , owen explained . END
`` something about the pollen '' . END
`` well , okay '' , buzz said . END
`` we'll see you around later '' . END
owen went over to the UNK table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't UNK with any consecutive success . END
`` how's your luck , honey '' ? ? END
a short platinum blonde in a bursting UNK addressed him . END
she looked UNK and prosperous , but he didn't get the impression he was being UNK the way he'd been hoping . END
`` i haven't had any luck since i was a baby '' . END
`` stake me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice . END
i'll make them dance the UNK . END
we'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' . END
`` let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' . END
`` if you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` i'll leave you '' . END
`` sounds like real love '' , owen said . END
`` it sort of brings a lump to my throat '' . END
`` my name's UNK '' , the blonde said after she ordered a scotch . END
`` named after the ballet . END
my mother wanted to call me UNK , but it sounded too affected '' . END
`` is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? ? END
spencer shook his head . END
alexander said , `` answer me properly , spencer '' . END
spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` there is nothing i want to say , captain '' . END
`` very well '' . END
naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor . END
philip spencer had UNK planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to UNK him for a lapse of proper address . END
during the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no UNK effect upon the men of the somers . END
those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so as to be near spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him . END
hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort . END
the two met in the captain's cabin . END
`` what is the next step , captain '' ? ? END
`` more UNK , i fear '' . END
in your opinion , who is this e. UNK on the ' certain ' list '' ? ? END
`` cromwell , of course . END
he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot . END
he saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a UNK . END
somehow he talked spencer into letting him use another name '' . END
there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain . END
`` have him come in '' . END
heiser , breathless and UNK , brought the chilling news that the UNK , UNK and UNK had been UNK removed from their customary places . END
`` and also , sir , two articles which were considered UNK now must be regarded in another light entirely . END
an african knife and UNK are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green . END
mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer's possession and that '' -- END
`` where did you gather all this information , heiser ? ? END
who reported to you the disappearance of UNK and UNK and who '' -- END
he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with gansevoort and heiser behind him . END
a glance revealed that the main UNK mast had been carried away . END
the aimless milling about of what had been a UNK , UNK crew struck alexander with horror . END
he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads UNK toward the UNK figure as though for further instruction . END
UNK UNK hastened to UNK side . END
`` small violently jerked the UNK brace with full intention to carry away the mast . END
i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell . END
i swear it , sir '' . END
and it was clear that UNK was not mistaken , for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new UNK mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey . END
then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work . END
alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and UNK . END
their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by philip spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated . END
when the mast was raised , alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers . END
spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and UNK , missing UNK without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal . END
one of the missing UNK came out of its hiding place after UNK UNK had been UNK disobeyed by seaman wilson . END
UNK had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by wilson , brandishing the weapon . END
wilson , UNK and UNK , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green , UNK and mckinley . END
not a man on the UNK , loyal or UNK , could be UNK by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of UNK . END
in the tiny cabin , alexander met with gansevoort , heiser and wales to speak and to listen . END
three days had passed since spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears . END
gansevoort said , `` it requires an UNK eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely . END
to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed . END
from actions aboard , it is easy to guess that spencer's boast of twenty UNK followers was a modest estimate '' . END
`` well '' , heiser ventured , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' -- END
`` that would be worse than useless '' , alexander broke in . END
`` there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners . END
besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ? END
then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order . END
mr. heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ? END
do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? ? END
wales said , `` of course they would . END
they are about to do so at any moment as it is . END
all that is needed is for one man to feel UNK enough to take the lead . END
as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer , we are going to be rushed . END
we are going to be rushed and murdered '' . END
`` that is extravagant language , mr. wales . END
we are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , alexander said . END
`` we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound '' . END
`` of course , i agree with the captain '' , gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is UNK and desperate . END
the instinct of discipline has been lost . END
anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand '' . END
he paused , then added , `` everything on a ship is a weapon . END
implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands . END
and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' . END
`` we ourselves must stand UNK '' . END
`` under arms day and night , watch and watch about . END
those of us present , the perry brothers , UNK and the other UNK now have the responsibility of the somers . END
a great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' . END
and when he was alone again in the cabin , alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done . END
with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy's UNK laws . END
and when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicated his soul . END
where had he failed ? ? END
how had he failed ? ? END
he who had tried so hard , who had UNK so UNK to be a great officer . END
it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven . END
it was given or it was not given . END
one did one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward . END
one did one's best and if fortune frowned , an UNK boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one's ship . END
and alexander UNK like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame . END
god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an UNK rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career . END
another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any UNK . END
it was for love that he had served the navy . END
to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for . END
now the hope was gone . END
yes , he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price . END
dear god , at what a price . END
and after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity . END
UNK , he UNK the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason . END
the prisoners UNK their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger . END
only cromwell , the giant UNK , was UNK and respectful . END
he said , `` captain , may i speak , please ? ? END
captain , i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' . END
`` are you , cromwell '' ? ? END
`` yes , sir . END
before god i swear i am innocent . END
i know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' . END
`` you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . END
`` i cannot speak for others , sir , but i am innocent '' . END
he leaned closer to alexander , UNK up at him from the deck . END
`` surely , captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' . END
`` no , cromwell , i did not find your name . END
you were careful about that '' . END
now spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke . END
he said , `` cromwell is telling you the truth . END
he is innocent '' . END
alexander shifted his gaze to spencer . END
the UNK and detachment of his tone suggested UNK of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell . END
alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or UNK . END
and in a sudden wave of painful clarity , alexander recognized a UNK with spencer . END
here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable . END
there was good fortune and there was bad and philip spencer , in UNK and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth . END
he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune . END
the UNK captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer . END
this tragic lad had UNK his own UNK . END
but he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him . END
and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the UNK captain , they would be each other's UNK . END
`` spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for cromwell to be innocent ? ? END
he was your constant companion '' . END
the UNK eyes met UNK . END
`` i tell you he is innocent '' . END
`` and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word '' ? ? END
i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell '' . END
`` nothing to lose , either , spencer '' . END
`` that's true '' , spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation . END
his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea . END
`` i am innocent , captain '' , cromwell said again . END
`` before god , captain , i am innocent '' . END
and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an UNK , still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell . END
the UNK was as guilty as any . END
no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four UNK , prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper , had seen it in UNK hands while spencer whispered explanations . END
`` i thought '' , UNK rogers had told alexander , `` that spencer was teaching him geometry '' . END
it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in UNK to the UNK , where a class of UNK awaited him . END
this was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized . END
some of these UNK were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencer's followers . END
rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the UNK . END
bits of UNK lay in the roadway . END
the air smelled UNK and foul . END
a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides . END
he wore a long UNK coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with UNK . END
his black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high . END
with his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead . END
he had a UNK complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled UNK . END
i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms . END
the girls in the market place wore UNK dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings . END
i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road . END
his hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , UNK on his heel , he entered an old stone building . END
rachel had seen me watching the young man . END
`` when your mother was here he must have been a young boy . END
like the ones you will see now '' . END
i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel . END
she led me into a twisting side alley . END
the dirty , UNK buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads . END
rachel said that schools and UNK occupied most of the buildings . END
we entered one where the front door stood UNK and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor . END
an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black UNK greeted us . END
rachel talked to him . END
he nodded , clasping and UNK his hands over his UNK , and flicked glances at me . END
i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were UNK , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor . END
his toes pointed out toward the walls . END
he stopped in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom . END
little boys crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher . END
his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat . END
one white hand poised a stick above his desk . END
he turned his UNK , UNK eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in yiddish , `` one , two , three '' ! ! END
UNK the stick against the desk . END
the little boys UNK out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses , which they had previously chanted in hebrew . END
they chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick . END
each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and UNK had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe . END
the boys were tiny . END
they had large bright eyes , the small UNK noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long UNK of UNK framing their little white faces . END
they bent over UNK UNK and looked up only to watch the teacher . END
since they did not glance curiously at us once , i guessed that there was a penalty for UNK . END
the UNK language from the ghetto stopped . END
the teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in hebrew , UNK the stick UNK . END
one boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and UNK . END
his tightly curled UNK hung down to his narrow shoulders . END
in the center of his brilliant UNK sat a small black UNK . END
his head barely rose above the table . END
i stared at him for a long time . END
he did not return my interest . END
my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys . END
some of them ignored the texts and had apparently UNK the words long ago . END
they UNK the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an UNK baritone and spurred them on with the stick . END
the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake . END
i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair . END
his body pitched back and forth on the bench . END
his front teeth were missing . END
i shuddered and backed out of the room . END
rachel followed , looked at me , and UNK with her tongue . END
we walked down the cool hall silently . END
from behind us came the UNK of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer . END
i said , `` how long do they keep that up '' ? ? END
`` all day '' , she said . END
`` except for UNK , when they are UNK all day '' . END
i rubbed my hands together . END
they had turned numb and UNK in the classroom . END
the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps . END
he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish . END
rachel said , `` he asks for money '' . END
she passed by him . END
i reached into the pocket of my skirt , UNK ten UNK , and dropped the coin . END
then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man . END
i didn't look at him . END
i grinned at rachel . END
`` does this bother you '' ? ? END
she smiled to herself . END
`` most of our UNK think it's horrible . END
when we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass . END
they said that we must not fight but wait for the UNK '' . END
you had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home . END
you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal . END
you had to know , also , that you were going to fail . END
all of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place . END
her bright eyes were UNK . END
she said , `` sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around . END
your mother hated this way of life . END
she wished to change much for the children here '' . END
i said quietly , UNK , `` what did she do here ? ? END
in this section '' ? ? END
rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth . END
`` here , nothing . END
but when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the UNK . END
she loved the children . END
she was a strange woman , your mother . END
when she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved . END
nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted . END
she stayed here to work for UNK . END
for many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother . END
sometimes it was dangerous for her '' . END
`` but she loved danger . END
she took it with her wherever she went ; ; END
and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people . END
she was most strange woman . END
ready to follow her impulse . END
it was an impulse when she was here in UNK UNK -- i was with her -- that led her to stay in israel . END
your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their ghettos . END
here they did not need to be in ghettos . END
if she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms . END
she set out to make sure that no jewish child UNK in the world had to live in a place such as this '' . END
i said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` then why did she leave israel ? ? END
i'd like to know that very much '' . END
rachel UNK her hands together and slowed her pace . END
the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the UNK . END
she UNK her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me . END
but she sighed and her face relaxed . END
`` trouble came into her life . END
she had good friends here , people who liked her . END
but she had to go out and hurt herself . END
there was a man here in town . END
he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted . END
she worked very hard . END
there was a refugee who was able to come here because of her . END
he came with his son . END
at first i thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so . END
this refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a UNK to his walk as i have never before seen . END
he had the black UNK on his arm , so he had been UNK in a concentration camp . END
yet he walked like a young man . END
often he was terribly UNK and talked to no one . END
then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe . END
all his family was dead , except for his son . END
your mother would always UNK him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son . END
he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him . END
then his son did something '' -- rachel threw up her hands -- `` i don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the mandate -- and the son was imprisoned . END
a few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed . END
she ran from a little group of us . END
we were sitting together , talking . END
she went to the father and found he had hanged himself '' . END
it was silent in the stone alley . END
then she continued with energy , `` i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father . END
no one saw her except the man reuveni '' . END
`` yes '' , i said . END
`` i know him '' . END
rachel gave me a direct , UNK look . END
she said , `` reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee . END
he said she would only hurt herself . END
he complained to me once that i must talk to her . END
when i did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him . END
i asked her if she would , and she said she would not . END
he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him . END
anyway , i did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself . END
she came to me one day . END
she was pale and skinny ; ; END
she was terribly alone . END
and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal . END
he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself . END
but now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her . END
he would never let her harm herself again . END
for one whole week he never let her stay alone . END
she let him lead her around . END
he took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was . END
reuveni took her with him wherever he went . END
he did not let her talk to people ; ; END
he did not let her choose her own food . END
she was limp and beaten from her loss ; ; END
she did not care . END
`` and i'll take you with me '' . END
the two of them against the world . END
that had been how she imagined it . END
for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too . END
but now the dream was over . END
the big waking up had happened . END
`` what did i imagine '' ? ? END
`` did i see him about to swing low in a UNK ? ? END
or maybe UNK up the south fork of the forked deer river UNK the wastes dumped in it ? ? END
maybe i saw him on a barge with a gang of UNK UNK it '' . END
and i'll take you with me . END
he had taken her all right . END
wednesday nights after youth fellowship . END
out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his UNK , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( UNK and naked as a UNK , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats UNK in after the bugs , watching in between your UNK at UNK ) , a room complete with UNK UNK the light and the few casual UNK cruising the walls , an insect highway patrol with UNK waving . END
and the bed that UNK in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for UNK talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened . END
and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along . END
like UNK and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and UNK UNK back in his office UNK out teeth , like they all knew he would . END
just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a UNK or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . END
or you could hope the UNK wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to UNK poe in his suit of red UNK , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` i think i'm pregnant '' . END
you could wish that . END
or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve UNK out of him like air out of a UNK tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . END
so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned UNK tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , UNK to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . END
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has UNK you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too . END
it is not having his baby UNK warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some UNK cracks your UNK . END
and most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry UNK down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one . END
he can even be a UNK UNK guy with UNK ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even UNK couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked . END
and he can be on the way to memphis , your gratt shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead . END
because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him . END
for you don't share him , not even with god . END
if it is love , you don't . END
and i'll take you with me . END
even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie . END
even when he is on the way to memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you . END
and in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart . END
you feel him every mile further away . END
you feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't . END
and you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the UNK who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the UNK shoes . END
you think : `` did he feel that way about me '' ? ? END
it comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have gratt shafer ; ; END
that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy . END
it UNK on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because gratt shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to gratt UNK substitute , that other guy . END
and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st. louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . END
you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you . END
you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you . END
`` damn the world '' , she thought . END
she looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the UNK fence bordering the grounds . END
the mayor envisioned factories there . END
homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments . END
the bands were impatient , but they were the only ones . END
the others , the ones in the stands , were UNK , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city . END
it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano UNK UNK . END
he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day . END
so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling . END
if a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever . END
you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too . END
it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it . END
you laughed and then your chest UNK and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose UNK UNK along your arm . END
he hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought . END
while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , rained enough to wet a UNK ass . END
she glanced at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks UNK into his lean cheeks , with UNK pale eyes reflecting all the UNK he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in august -- yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only june , only festival time again and thoughts of gratt shafer would not leave her . END
`` i should have stayed at the store '' , she thought . END
back at the UNK with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the UNK toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down . END
there was no lock because herman didn't allow a lock . END
a lock on the toilet would encourage UNK and UNK . END
the toilet hadn't had a sincere UNK in years and there were things written on the walls of the little UNK place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely . END
she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall . END
the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would UNK open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , UNK clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot . END
and the hours were UNK in the morning until eleven at night on UNK and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor . END
among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs . END
each of us had his own specialty besides . END
george did wonderful complicated UNK drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details UNK into an UNK sheet and looking as if they had been done under a UNK glass . END
he also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , the new yorker , for instance , or UNK . END
i did book jackets and covers for UNK UNK : naked girls UNK in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver . END
the book could be the brothers karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . END
i remember once i did a jacket for UNK press ; ; END
the book was a fine historical novel about edward 3 , , and i did a week of research to get the details just right : the UNK armor , furnishings , clothes . END
i even UNK out the materials from which UNK were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so i'd get the light reflections accurate . END
UNK , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` nothing doing , UNK . END
in the first place , it's static ; ; END
in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ; END
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold '' . END
i said , `` mr. UNK , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' . END
he said , `` that may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think . END
they know from their UNK into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing UNK like little lord UNK , and only the villains had beards . END
and girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough '' . END
in the end , i did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the UNK of a costume movie . END
UNK was as happy as a UNK . END
`` that's authenticity '' , he said . END
as for donald , he actually sold paintings . END
we all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it . END
he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to joyce UNK or her friends . END
he had style , a real inner vision of his very own . END
it was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults . END
there was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye . END
we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so UNK . END
it may have been true for all i know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting . END
he also had , at times , an uncanny UNK air like a UNK ; ; END
he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` for christ's sake , donald , you've got UNK blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well . END
mrs. UNK thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . END
it was all gravy , and donald didn't need much to live on ; ; END
none of us did . END
we shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap UNK of one kind or another . END
attending the life class was my idea -- or rather , UNK idea , but i was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if i hadn't talked them into it . END
i wanted to paint again . END
i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year . END
it wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse i often used , even to myself . END
it was the kind of work i was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting . END
i kept saying , `` if i could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an UNK -- like peter askington , for instance -- then i could take some time off and paint '' . END
askington was a kind of goal i set myself ; ; END
i had admired him long before i talked to him . END
it looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . END
the night we first met , at one of mrs. UNK giant parties , he was wearing a brown UNK jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink UNK shirt ; ; END
instead of a UNK he wore a leather UNK drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure UNK . END
this set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the UNK rent for a year . END
he was fifteen years older than i -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle . END
he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man , and his lively and UNK speech made him seem even younger . END
he was one of the most prominent magazine UNK in america ; ; END
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month . END
life had included him in its `` modern american artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the east sixties ; ; END
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have UNK in it painting the royalty of spain . END
i had a long talk with him . END
we went into mrs. UNK library , which had low UNK all along the walls , and above them a UNK portrait , a jackson pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous UNK with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb . END
the fireplace had tiles made for mrs. UNK by picasso himself . END
like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself . END
in the course of our talk , askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying . END
`` by yourself '' ? ? END
`` no , i take classes with different people '' , he said . END
`` i don't think i've reached the point , yet , where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft . END
besides , it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as UNK went to italy to meet UNK and UNK '' . END
he made a circle with his thumb and fingers . END
`` painting isn't this big , you know . END
it doesn't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel . END
it is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , UNK '' . END
he threw his arms wide , his face shining . END
`` the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no , he is more than that , a UNK performer in some vast philharmonic . END
one of these days , i'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract UNK to extreme UNK , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other . END
the eye is all , inward or outward . END
ah , what a title for the exhibition : the eye is all '' ! ! END
`` what do you study '' ? ? END
i was fascinated ; ; END
just listening to him made me feel intelligent . END
`` i'm studying anatomy with burns '' , he replied . END
`` maybe you know him . END
he teaches at the manhattan school of art '' . END
i had studied with burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me , along with the UNK prize for my paintings of UNK on hudson street . END
burns and i had not loved each other . END
`` i'm also studying UNK with UNK UNK '' , he went on , `` and twice a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton '' . END
`` UNK pendleton '' ? ? END
`` my god , is he still alive ? ? END
he must be a million years old . END
i went to a UNK of his work when i was eighteen , and i thought he was a contemporary of UNK '' . END
`` not quite '' . END
`` he's about sixty , now . END
still painting , still a kind of modern UNK , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms . END
he even makes the city look like one of UNK UNK . END
i've always admired him , and when i heard he was taking a few pupils , i went to him and joined his class '' . END
`` yes , it sounds great '' , i said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an UNK painter '' ? ? END
`` you're missing the point '' , he said . END
`` he has the magical eye . END
and he is a great man . END
contact with him is stimulating . END
and that's the trouble with so many artists today . END
they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life . END
that's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation . END
in the middle ages , in the renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world . END
he was an UNK , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a UNK or a wood UNK did . END
he filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , UNK its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses . END
he was a UNK -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- UNK , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . END
but look at us today ! ! END
we hold safe little jobs illustrating UNK ads or the UNK incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the UNK out of the UNK so it can be contemplated in greater purity . END
a bunch of amateur UNK ! ! END
what we need is to get back to the group , to learning and UNK , to the cafe and the school '' . END
he could certainly talk . END
the UNK of the evening was that i got the address of UNK studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . END
it was an awkward hour , but i didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . END
after a short time , both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the UNK reading out to work . END
it was mostly for the benefit of the UNK , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . END
in a way , askington was right . END
`` stimulating '' was the word for it . END
i don't know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it to be . END
partly , it was because pendleton himself wasn't what i anticipated . END
i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead UNK . END
no , that isn't quite fair . END
actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week . END
such a little thing to start with -- the car registration . END
`` UNK , where is the car license '' ? ? END
`` i can't find it in the glove compartment '' . END
`` via must have it '' , i answered readily enough , recalling her last visit . END
`` via '' , she was frowning . END
`` why should via have it '' ? ? END
had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? ? END
i didn't want to stir things up . END
`` i drive my own car by courtesy of via '' ? ? END
`` i'm sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather . END
you know that '' . END
she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud . END
`` she must have taken the registration when she went to UNK . END
i'll call her '' . END
`` no , thank you . END
i want nothing of UNK '' . END
why should this suddenly UNK her ? ? END
walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills . END
had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ? END
`` what a fool i've been '' , she said quietly . END
`` i knew all this , but i paid no attention . END
i don't even own the house i'm standing in . END
i was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things END
`` it UNK down down down and finally there is no way out . END
if i am not to be mrs. salter i am nothing '' . END
i suppose i should have paid attention to that UNK remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . END
i love you , i hate you , i feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . END
so i went about my business . END
i made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , UNK some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the UNK for the weekend . END
`` don't bother , UNK '' , she said . END
`` i have these appointments in town for saturday , and i'll probably spend sunday with dolly or the UNK '' . END
at last , i thought , she's recovering her spirits . END
with this UNK in london , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more UNK , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here . END
i felt more cheerful , as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself . END
and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life . END
it was foggy that evening , but the path to my house was so well UNK that i could feel my way , accustomed as i was to the dense UNK that rise from the UNK UNK of the river and sometimes last for days . END
in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on . END
i did notice a UNK of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs. salter had done the same before she left for town . END
i did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there i went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when i drove home in the late afternoon . END
but the next day -- sunday . END
why , when i drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear ? ? END
prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , UNK . END
when i came back from church at noon mrs. UNK was turning into the salter driveway . END
even at a car's length i could sense that something was wrong , and so i followed her up to the UNK in front of the house . END
dolly UNK was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us . END
`` she's nowhere , nowhere '' ! ! END
she screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and i followed . END
the search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening UNK , talking , exclaiming in UNK and gasps . END
everything was as i had left it the night before last -- her UNK and bag for town , her UNK and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing . END
then the UNK began . END
i , who until that day before had been mrs. UNK friend , her equal , was the servant now . END
it was dolly and mrs. UNK who were calling via , everybody . END
and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me . END
and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait . END
sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs. salter said that could have been a sign to me . END
`` if i am not to be mrs. salter then i am nothing '' . END
why didn't that alarm me then ? ? END
and when she returned from taking her guests back to new york she had said , `` all they talked about was UNK UNK this , UNK that when they know the truth will they drop away from me , will i become a nothing '' ? ? END
and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast , over and over again , `` on the boat people liked me for myself '' . END
i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check . END
the last night i had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me . END
i assumed it was one of those UNK conversations with dolly or UNK , she comfortable in bed . END
but it seemed not from what they were saying . END
then was it a final desperate plea from her , to whom ? ? END
hanging on and on past any man's patience some final UNK of conclusion ? ? END
she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff . END
i tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing . END
sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff . END
it's so romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its UNK like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic . END
with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock , a UNK . END
but i didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else . END
when a fisherman brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , i began to shudder with a terrible excitement , almost triumphant , that i still cannot account for . END
was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks ? ? END
that at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ? END
or what was it that , before via , UNK , walter and all , i began almost to dance with UNK and cry out , `` i knew she'd do it ! ! END
i knew '' ! ! END
everyone stared at me and drew back . END
their eyes turned cold and accusing , even UNK . END
and they have never changed . END
at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and UNK her , underneath this knowing had there burned UNK by my pity a fire of hate , an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly UNK ? ? END
was that what had given way in me ? ? END
even now i am UNK at how little anyone knows of what they really are . END
it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation UNK me from the family i considered my very own , but there it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other . END
at the time i was filled with UNK at this separation , but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that UNK . END
in my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that i could have prevented it , i can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a UNK for what is not to be borne . END
it is not their avoidance that UNK ; ; END
it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so coolly and walk away , that it hurts . END
i could tell them , but no one ever asked , why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body . END
no , i forget mrs. UNK , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . END
she haunted me ; ; END
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs. salter to return to the country . END
`` we all feel guilty '' , i turned away from her coldly . END
`` it was nobody's fault . END
she UNK her hand '' . END
`` what do you mean '' ? ? END
`` why put such a high value on being top dog '' ? ? END
it was coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see me since . END
but suppose she had not taken mrs. UNK advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , UNK of love , hanging on to UNK , and altogether and finally UNK . END
if she chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her fullest height , and UNK her murky self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision ? ? END
if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions . END
yes , i had cried out that i knew she'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her UNK from UNK and UNK -- and guilt . END
she was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice . END
at rest with my darling ellen , the first mrs. salter . END
mr. salter came home . END
the funeral service was in the house , the methodist minister , how clean and glistening his UNK and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming UNK in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed . END
then via called to say they had decided to UNK her -- as they had ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning . END
the coffin stood on UNK in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the UNK of white roses i had ordered . END
i knelt , just for decency i thought at the time , but found myself whispering , `` our father which art in heaven '' and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and i felt a grief . END
via was in the parking lot when i went outside . END
together we waited in her car until the UNK moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey . END
by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the UNK auditorium with its UNK symbols of religious UNK . END
again i felt impelled to kneel , and reached back and pulled via down . END
something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing . END
`` i had a rather small place of my own . END
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the UNK arms '' . END
`` UNK '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left UNK . END
`` and then i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio '' . END
`` i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him . END
`` oh , i'd drink with newspaper people . END
i think i was what you might call a UNK man , and yet it was when i was alone in my studio , doing my work , that i really felt alive . END
but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . END
pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question . END
she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little . END
`` well , what about you , carla '' ? ? END
`` me '' ? ? END
she asked , turning slowly . END
`` what about me '' ? ? END
`` did you make friends easily '' ? ? END
`` UNK , UNK '' . END
`` somehow i imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot . END
how about it '' ? ? END
`` i guess so '' , she said taking a UNK from her purse . END
when she had wiped some of the UNK from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror . END
`` are your people still alive '' ? ? END
he asked , trying to touch a part of her life UNK hadn't discussed ; ; END
so he could have something of her for himself . END
`` you talk so well , carla '' , he went on . END
`` you seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to UNK her vanity . END
`` you must have been good at history at school . END
where did you go to school '' ? ? END
`` what is this '' ? ? END
she asked , turning suddenly . END
`` don't you know all about me by this time ? ? END
my name's carla UNK . END
this is my town . END
i sleep with you . END
you know something more about me every day , don't you ? ? END
would you be happier if i made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? ? END
why are you trying to worry me '' ? ? END
`` i'm not trying to worry you '' . END
`` well , all right then '' . END
the cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing . END
at home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance . END
was she just naturally UNK about everything but her physical appearance ? ? END
would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? ? END
he straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid . END
if he UNK on the UNK he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too . END
`` what's the matter '' ? ? END
nothing at all '' , he said quietly . END
`` let's go out '' . END
`` are those the only shoes you have , sam '' ? ? END
`` what's the matter with them '' ? ? END
`` the heavy thick soles . END
look at them '' . END
`` they're an expensive english shoe for walking around a lot . END
i like them '' . END
`` sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles . END
can't you get another pair '' ? ? END
`` maybe i could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him . END
`` i'll get an elegant pair of UNK italian shoes tomorrow , carla '' . END
`` and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face . END
`` what's the matter with it '' ? ? END
he had put on the gray jacket and the UNK slacks and the UNK shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had encountered her on the street . END
`` oh , sam . END
you look like a UNK englishman . END
can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ? ? END
`` i don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . END
changing his clothes , he put on his UNK flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good . END
but it was a hopeful sign , he told himself . END
she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in UNK . END
that day they UNK around , just getting the feel of the city . END
they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via UNK , then they went to the UNK gardens . END
she had some amusing scandal about the UNK in the old days . END
then they took a taxi to UNK . END
`` there's a church you should see '' , she said . END
and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with UNK . END
he let her tell him all about the church . END
then they had dinner . END
all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself . END
when they got home at midnight she was tired out . END
and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing . END
he had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her UNK him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps . END
it was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought . END
she might like to take him to st. peter's . END
`` carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her . END
`` it's ten o'clock . END
aren't you going out to mass ? ? END
you could take me to st. peter's '' . END
`` UNK '' , she muttered . END
`` come on , you'll be late '' . END
`` i think i'll sleep in this morning '' , she said UNK , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church . END
why did he want her to go to church ? ? END
he wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security . END
it would be good for her . END
it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church . END
not his poor mother's fault . END
she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible . END
as for himself , he just didn't have the temperament for it . END
from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know . END
then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the UNK chapel . END
just figures out of a tribal folklore . END
could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ? ? END
being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church . END
it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself . END
or a protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic UNK , or a strict orthodox communist . END
what was the matter with him that they all UNK him ? ? END
it was the times , he was sure . END
all the UNK changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? ? END
it was all too UNK . END
just the same , he thought , UNK over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church . END
a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the UNK , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . END
it seemed to him that if the UNK felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla . END
`` since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` i think i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . END
and he waited for her to say , `` oh , no , i can do it , sam . END
there's so little to do '' . END
`` why not '' ? ? END
`` i'm not good at that kind of thing '' . END
`` this afternoon let's take an air with them . END
let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking . END
`` if you find it necessary , sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the UNK . END
`` i am what i am . END
i can't help it '' . END
her words remained with him , worrying him for hours . END
he didn't know how she would behave with other people . END
when they walked into the UNK apartment , the old lady , UNK and smiling , said softly . END
`` UNK , '' and put out her hand . END
her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things . END
agnese , smiling too , said , `` UNK '' , and then more slowly , `` i am happy '' . END
and they sat down and began their little coffee party . END
the UNK offered them biscuits with the coffee . END
acting only as interpreter carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal . END
she would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again . END
watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth . END
UNK UNK , UNK her head UNK , asked sam about canada , having a special interest . END
the old woman had a nephew from north italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had UNK to canada to work on the railway . END
for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar . END
did many of sam's countrymen live in UNK in the bush ? ? END
had sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ? END
she wanted to know . END
UNK sam explained that he had no experience with UNK . END
just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country . END
and sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the pope . END
a very great pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling . END
but very mystical too . END
it was said that he had had a vision . END
just as thousands that day in portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to agnese for confirmation . END
agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware . END
now a little flush came on her pale homely face and UNK in her eyes . END
the holy father would die soon , she said to carla , so she could translate for sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world . END
yes , the pope could die and quickly be made a saint . END
no , he was indeed a saint now . END
nodding UNK and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially . END
there was a certain discontent among the cardinals . END
the pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little . END
there would be changes made , and UNK raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome . END
jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent . END
did UNK raymond understand ? ? END
indeed he did , sam said solemnly , trying to get UNK eye . END
surely she could see that these women were her italians , too , he thought . END
devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or UNK or ireland . END
but UNK eyes were on agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness . END
and carla , watching in wonder , turned to sam . END
`` it means so much to her . END
it's like a flame , i guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone . END
but one night UNK moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where shades of night had gone to UNK herself . END
with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the UNK with his lips , making it whisper . END
he saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her UNK fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme UNK and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach . END
in her dark , scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding . END
seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart bounce in him , and turned away , afraid now . END
even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil UNK in her UNK more . END
his breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off . END
going , he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the UNK when they are perhaps pressed by the UNK . END
he cried out to her , his back turned . END
then he fled , not waiting to see if she UNK him or took notice of his cry . END
but she heard him go . END
yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp . END
elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their UNK then gathering in small , curious clusters . END
early spring came from her bed , from beside her UNK husband , walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of UNK voices . END
standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost UNK , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her . END
when at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl's scorn , she said in a voice UNK : END
`` i shall call your father ! ! END
go back where you can bring no harm , or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! ! END
but the girl said only , `` tell him i am here , that i have come '' . END
and it was not pile of clouds she meant . END
but now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , early spring stood like a she wolf before her UNK and cried , `` i will not shriek at you ! ! END
i will tell you to go , not begging . END
telling you '' ! ! END
and UNK the knife she used for UNK hides she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side . END
`` you bring only UNK '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal . END
speaking in a low voice of UNK she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife . END
`` go take UNK , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said . END
`` they do not have to face battle . END
i will not let your evil in . END
i will simply kill you first . END
now go '' ! ! END
the other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats UNK , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt . END
they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl . END
the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs . END
they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought . END
but she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came UNK among them , swinging a great UNK whip . END
`` go back to your UNK '' ! ! END
`` a pack of dogs makes less noise '' ! ! END
he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some UNK over themselves in their flight . END
and early spring seized the whip and said : END
`` if you must UNK someone , let it be her , your daughter . END
drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! ! END
but the old man turned on her , UNK the whip from her hand . END
`` get into your UNK '' ! ! END
`` go back to that UNK man of yours who so UNK his fine body among the young women . END
keep him back , if you must tell me what to do . END
i will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! ! END
she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred , UNK , sitting up in a half stupor to say : END
`` what UNK thing happens ? ? END
i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting '' . END
but she went to him and pressed herself against his UNK , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from UNK . END
she said , `` there is nothing that concerns you here . END
lie back and go to sleep . END
but do not dream . END
do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain '' . END
he sank back , sighing , and was soon asleep again . END
outside , the old man , beyond all the UNK of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the UNK UNK of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her UNK ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms . END
and , shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , UNK its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale UNK of the bark so close to her face . END
she said to him , her father , `` how was i begotten , in pain or joy ? ? END
is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ? END
they all know your foolish name '' ! ! END
she stared at the pale UNK on the tree , hearing her breath UNK from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark . END
she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in UNK UNK words which had no meaning , like , `` UNK ! ! END
the sounds of an animal in rage and despair . END
suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high , UNK voice : END
`` did you follow me to see my shame ? ? END
move from the line or i will settle the whip on you . END
do you hear the anger of the UNK whine '' ? ? END
turning , the girl saw UNK standing between , his narrow shoulders UNK , his arms hanging long and resigned . END
he said , `` let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too '' . END
then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , UNK her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the UNK of her heart and wanting for once to cry . END
for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of UNK , UNK in his harsh language as he talked with himself . END
he shouted like a hoarse old UNK , his hair stiff and UNK . END
he UNK and prophesied the UNK of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping UNK until finally , incoherent and sick , he fell into his own UNK . END
he amused the young men who had been silent long enough . END
but they could taste the UNK of violence and retribution through his antics . END
now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , UNK the gloom they saw in the faces around them . END
they came out and held their games and races . END
it was they who held the future in their hands . END
they went into the sun together and UNK UNK in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred UNK dug far off in the cave of UNK . END
they danced the UNK wildly at night , the war dance , and UNK their UNK in the UNK of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in UNK at some indeterminate signal . END
walitzee was among them , and UNK , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing . END
and a very young one , UNK UNK , tried to UNK them and followed UNK . END
yellow wolf was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the UNK UNK of youth worked . END
he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his UNK UNK . END
all the young men , UNK among them , challenged them in matched racing . END
they raced and UNK for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry . END
at times they would ride UNK through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their UNK . END
then again they would stand in circles making other preparations . END
they combed their hair and streaked it at the part and UNK the bangs so that the hair above their UNK stood rigid like the tails of UNK hens making love . END
walitzee UNK his UNK with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees . END
he saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow , hurtling with a mad grace , his UNK shining and scented with meadow rue . END
he was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , admiring him . END
and the suspicious , UNK eyes of pile of clouds . END
and those of early spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy . END
he felt so much like laughing ; ; END
even like shouting and crying out from the UNK from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the UNK . END
he and UNK planned a great parade with the young men . END
they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their UNK . END
they would ride with streaming UNK , their colors UNK in the sun , shouting the last UNK of a nation in the UNK of death . END
and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and UNK which ran with their hearts . END
they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills . END
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening . END
the sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , UNK hoofs of the UNK , horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell . END
he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge . END
standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , UNK legion , their hair flying like dark UNK , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad UNK of the hoofs accompanying them . END
they leaned into the wind and seemed like one UNK monster hurtling and UNK until suddenly they rose straight in their UNK and in one terrifying voice shouted , UNK their grotesque cry of war . END
she was moving through a screen of UNK , in among the white UNK and UNK . END
the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears . END
she stood , once more listening . END
she had never been here at this hour . END
she felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; END
but she found the path she always used , the UNK of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; END
and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her . END
if i ever committed suicide , she thought , i would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . END
she smiled , and UNK let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her UNK sliding in the leaves . END
she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and , seating herself , shook her UNK brown hair and tilted her chin far upward . END
the UNK music of the UNK had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was vibrant . END
julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and UNK her hands tightly around the bent knees . END
she had accomplished a miracle . END
this was her place . END
the hour couldn't change it . END
only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange . END
they were becoming confused . END
perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now . END
she was thinking of paul a few weeks ago , in the easter holidays , with her at one of those awful friday evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend . END
`` hello , julie , how are you '' ? ? END
and then off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a UNK dress , someone without a UNK of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him . END
i wish he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment . END
i wish i were older or younger , julia UNK thought . END
i wish so much someone loved me . END
george rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- millie , in a white robe , standing like a ghost at the threshold . END
she had vanished ; ; END
he must have slept again . END
he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him . END
it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ; END
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning . END
this room was like a prison . END
he would not be indebted to sam ! ! END
below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner . END
his fingers fumbled across the UNK . END
they had left both of his eyes uncovered . END
well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road . END
he was walking across to the bathroom . END
he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands . END
a fearful pain had come from his head , as if the water were UNK up through the blood vessels and expanding them . END
he recognized his jacket and trousers . END
the fabric was dark ; ; END
the stains weren't too apparent ; ; END
and there were his shoes , thank god , but his shirt was one terrible mess . END
he UNK , and then tore away the UNK parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf . END
sam would be amazed to find him gone . END
millie would have to understand . END
she must have put his clothes in the closet . END
he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of UNK . END
he was on the UNK of tears . END
alex UNK -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that UNK gentleman . END
at least alex had told him he wasn't dying . END
perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead . END
what time was it ? ? END
he peered at his UNK . END
strange , it was still running . END
a quarter to seven . END
too early for a vacuum cleaner , but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs . END
he was kneeling to tie his UNK . END
his fingers felt UNK thick and clumsy . END
he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door . END
he barely knew himself . END
this was some freak , two UNK of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of UNK , suddenly moist over his cheekbones . END
the surface , however , was perfectly white . END
he was drinking another glass of water . END
it was after seven o'clock . END
he was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at city hall . END
who would take over ? ? END
he'd have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before sam UNK was up and about , and before millie UNK him with sympathy . END
he entered the hallway . END
he was actually walking down the stairs . END
a plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this UNK wreck of a man desperately trying to get away . END
`` father , is that you '' ? ? END
the voice issued from the UNK of the hall below . END
george did not reply . END
`` is that you , father ? ? END
who's there '' ? ? END
for a moment he felt like a thief discovered . END
then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room . END
she stood gazing at him . END
`` uncle george '' ! ! END
he was trying to smile at her . END
you shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ? END
`` i -- i was just leaving here , julie . END
just about to call a taxi '' . END
she was wearing some sort of gray UNK . END
she seemed overly tall , her brow knitted in concern . END
`` well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying . END
`` i'm about to leave myself . END
i'll drop you off '' . END
`` you're leaving '' ? ? END
`` i'm going back to school '' , she answered . END
`` UNK driving me . END
i'm just finishing breakfast . END
but have you told mother you were going '' ? ? END
i just don't want anyone disturbed , julie . END
it's quite a big one '' , he added . END
her face seemed to UNK in an UNK bright shaft of sunlight . END
`` well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ? END
or maybe a drink '' ? ? END
she asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful . END
he tried to see her face more clearly . END
`` no -- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment's hesitation . END
`` i'll just wait for you here '' . END
he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids . END
`` i have to say good-bye upstairs . END
i won't be long '' . END
`` as a great favor , julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me '' . END
`` not to anyone '' ? ? END
`` no -- please . END
`` i'll call your mother as soon as i get home . END
it'll be so much easier '' . END
`` all right '' she was staring at him . END
`` i'm fine , julie . END
please , you just go ahead '' . END
he could feel a pulse pounding against the UNK . END
he imagined sam's voice : `` george , what the hell goes on '' ? ? END
i wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought . END
maybe i couldn't have called a taxi . END
he could hear the footsteps overhead . END
he saw the suitcase , which julia was holding . END
`` i'll take that , julie -- for you '' . END
`` oh no '' , she said . END
`` i can manage '' . END
she went ahead of him . END
outside the lincoln was parked . END
he could hardly believe he was getting in . END
UNK was gazing at him in an UNK , UNK fashion ; ; END
but that didn't matter . END
we'll drop mr. rawlings off in UNK '' , julia said , and for the UNK second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants . END
to the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ; END
yet her UNK seemed forced or rehearsed . END
he could not stop to analyze . END
he had never felt particularly close to her . END
UNK seemed more affectionate , but obviously julia had respected his request . END
he took her hand . END
`` i wish i didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` i wish you lived in new york . END
that's in the opposite direction '' . END
`` i wish i did '' , he responded . END
`` i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' he stopped speaking . END
`` forget we ever knew what '' ? ? END
`` oh , just sort of everything in general '' . END
she said nothing until UNK had UNK their pace . END
`` i know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say '' . END
`` does it '' ? ? END
`` yes , perhaps . END
i'm supposed to joke about things , aren't i ? ? END
but sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business '' . END
his voice seemed thick and UNK . END
he relinquished her hand . END
he could see the stone building where he lived . END
just a few more steps . END
abruptly he reached into his pocket . END
yes , there was the key . END
`` are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ? END
for a moment he smiled . END
`` yes , julie dear . END
you've done me the greatest possible service . END
by myself i'll be fine '' . END
`` take care of yourself then '' . END
don't work too hard '' . END
it was an automatic phrase ; ; END
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it . END
he should have discovered a more tender farewell . END
someone shouted at him , `` well ! ! END
will you look at george rawlings ! ! END
what happened to you '' ? ? END
`` i UNK into a door handle '' , george said . END
george walked steadily ahead into his entry . END
his UNK seemed on fire . END
he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it . END
in the UNK the raw whiskey made him UNK . END
just one or two UNK , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain . END
`` no , millie , i'm home . END
no , really , right as rain . END
tell sam not to worry about the car . END
i'll get it hauled away . END
no , please -- no visit today -- i'll be asleep . END
for god's sake , don't worry . END
that UNK me more than anything . END
yes , sure , i'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist . END
there was one more call to make . END
`` joan , did i wake you '' ? ? END
`` yes , i thought you'd probably be up . END
look , sweetheart , some fool was . END
happened to be driving somewhat UNK last night . END
unfortunately it turned out to be me , but i wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss . END
oh hell no , i'm not in a hospital . END
i won't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon . END
too bad a jury isn't involved . END
i might struggle in for a jury . END
i'd win hands down . END
but i thought maybe tony elliott could UNK for me . END
he'll understand -- you might give him sort of a UNK UNK . END
he's got all the facts . END
i wouldn't want to ask for a UNK -- it's really just a routine thing . END
no , darling i'd rather you didn't come out '' . END
a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape . END
`` don't even send flowers . END
i'll see you wednesday . END
i'll UNK you with a nice '' -- he was about to say `` double martini '' but thought better of it . END
`` i'll take you out to dinner . END
he had put down the receiver . END
a strange relationship between joan UNK and himself . END
who knew about it ? ? END
she lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those UNK houses whose brick facade some early UNK had constructed . END
she had two tiny rooms on the second floor . END
she was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary . END
she let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her . END
in the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ; END
yet if he said : make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her . END
`` they make us UNK look good '' . END
`` that's a peculiar way to think '' . END
it wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had UNK her own feathers , of course ; ; END
it was jim's `` little '' sister myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever UNK , myra . END
she's a year older than i am , lucy told herself . END
`` come , come '' , jim said , UNK lucy a little . END
`` i love you . END
susan ready '' ? ? END
obviously , susan was not . END
upstairs , busy feet , UNK like UNK , UNK around her room . END
susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a UNK soul ; ; END
she always packed for a lifetime , just in case . END
every doll in the house must be going with her '' . END
`` she'd better step on it . END
it's a long way to UNK '' . END
jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ; END
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety . END
`` you know '' , he said . END
`` myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy . END
it'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' . END
lucy did not believe him ; ; END
jim had put the thanks in his UNK mouth . END
`` darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend . END
`` she should have told me herself . END
and will it be only a couple of weeks ? ? END
remember what happened the last time '' ? ? END
leaving cathy with them , myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; END
but she had stayed all winter , and cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them . END
lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if UNK , myra's husband , hadn't gone out to fetch her . END
`` that was an awfully long two weeks '' . END
for an otherwise silent moment , jim's keys UNK UNK in his pocket . END
`` but she promised -- this will be different '' , he said at last . END
`` you've got to admit she was smart to UNK up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and cathy in no time . END
you'll see , myra's settling down '' . END
on the defensive , he added , `` i wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' . END
`` it depends on the widow '' . END
lucy had an idea that myra loved it . END
and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down . END
it seemed to lucy that all their married life , she and jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life . END
remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered cathy , an ominous UNK on her horizon . END
it was not that she disliked cathy . END
the youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ; END
whenever lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from myra . END
but cathy was myra's responsibility , not hers . END
`` i wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if myra tried to leave her with us forever '' . END
myra loved big cities ; ; END
thousands of miles away -- in paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother . END
lucy knew her too well to find it impossible . END
`` that's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! ! END
jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming UNK of a UNK . END
he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , UNK , `` susan ! ! END
get moving '' ! ! END
a startled piping sound returned . END
`` don't yell at susan '' , lucy said . END
was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the UNK river ? ? END
their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; END
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them . END
then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had UNK ; ; END
myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line . END
jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her . END
his dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed . END
`` please '' , he said . END
`` there isn't a chance of myra's letting anything like that happen . END
let's stay friends '' . END
but they weren't just friends , lucy thought ; ; END
they were husband and wife , and myra had no right UNK and chilling their marriage . END
the only thing that had ever come between them was that UNK , selfish sister of his . END
lucy was sick of it . END
`` well , at last '' , she said , because susan was UNK down the stairs . END
susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ; END
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls . END
`` i'm ready '' , she announced . END
`` do you need that big bundle '' ? ? END
his voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment . END
`` all that junk '' ? ? END
susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ; END
to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart . END
`` now , now '' , lucy said , approaching susan with a handkerchief , UNK skillfully . END
`` your father didn't mean it , susan '' . END
she gave jim a quick , UNK look of warning . END
`` she'll take every one of them '' . END
jim UNK , but he lifted UNK suitcase and said , in a UNK tone , `` sure -- the entire thousand . END
and when you get back from UNK , cathy will be here to play with you . END
`` no '' , susan said , grappling with her UNK UNK of dolls with a UNK effect . END
and at this point , lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little UNK sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with susan ; ; END
there ought to be a limit to sharing , too . END
that was one more reason she didn't look forward to UNK visit , short or long ; ; END
the last one had been a UNK war . END
she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had . END
`` well '' , jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' . END
when the car , with UNK hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , lucy stood looking after its pale dust . END
the day was brilliant around her -- UNK , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it . END
she had let jim go with a chilly good-by , a UNK kiss . END
she was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that . END
she turned and began to walk toward the house . END
at the feeding station , the UNK group of UNK again UNK and UNK over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered UNK . END
the handsome bird was solitary ; ; END
its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest . END
she had better stay there , lucy thought ; ; END
the sly female UNK took instant advantage of UNK without UNK . END
well , lucy ? ? END
she said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the UNK . END
she had a day of things to do ; ; END
among them , she had to prepare the guest room . END
how long would it be occupied ? ? END
she wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness . END
as long as the unscrupulous myra chose ? ? END
for a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself . END
it isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's UNK . END
in the sunshine of late afternoon , lucy stood looking at the ready guest room . END
there were new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new UNK , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze . END
a row of little UNK waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; END
since myra had always put most of greg's money on her own back , lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed . END
the closet was faintly UNK with lavender , and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with UNK eyes . END
many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her . END
out in the hall , the upstairs phone UNK , and the small ghost vanished . END
when she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there . END
`` UNK junction calling '' , she said . END
`` i just thought i'd let you know . END
myra dropped cathy this morning , and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago . END
i'd have phoned sooner but i've been busy '' . END
`` i can imagine '' ! ! END
susan was an active character ; ; END
for mother to be able to call , susan must be UNK now , surrounded by her UNK of dolls . END
lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ; END
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her . END
you could think yourself as grown up as UNK , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic . END
`` how was cathy '' ? ? END
but myra was the UNK widow i ever saw '' . END
on her way to the airport , on her way to paris -- you bet , lucy said to herself . END
`` i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy '' . END
there was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` how long is she supposed to stay '' ? ? END
`` just for a couple of weeks , till myra finds a place for them '' . END
`` well '' -- this time there was a long silence , while the telephone UNK faintly with a UNK life . END
puzzled , lucy stared at the UNK wallpaper ; ; END
her mother was forthright ; ; END
she was not usually given to mysterious UNK . END
was she thinking along the same lines lucy was -- that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good ? ? END
`` you mean once myra gets to paris '' ? ? END
once the soft , pretty UNK found the bright light she had always wanted ? ? END
suddenly , UNK , lucy asked , `` mother , do you know something i don't know '' ? ? END
again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` i guess i do . END
just before myra left -- she was saying good-by to cathy , and she didn't realize i was near '' . END
she hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them . END
`` cathy was in tears , of course , and i heard myra say , ' now be good , and at UNK i'll send you a wonderful present from paris ' '' . END
shocked UNK , lucy sat there . END
then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord UNK like a black snake . END
'' then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ; END
it was only too true . END
myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks . END
for a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it . END
`` that does it '' ! ! END
`` i'll keep cathy for two weeks . END
then , if myra does nothing about UNK her , i'll pack her right back to her mother -- if i have to take her myself '' ! ! END
her hand tightened on the receiver . END
`` and that's what i'm going to tell jim '' . END
for lucy , the day's nagging UNK had come to an abrupt end . END
as she hung up , she saw through the UNK open window the UNK flying of the UNK wings , and heard their grotesque singing . END
she's not going to get away with it . END
cathy is tired , lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path . END
the child's thin legs were plodding . END
she trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear . END
she was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her UNK and uncle's house . END
unlike susan , she was traveling light ; ; END
the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had . END
lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the UNK of stays ; ; END
they would have to buy things for her . END
she opened the door . END
unimpressed , the dog UNK on the sand . END
quint couldn't blame maggie for UNK . END
for eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before UNK beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and UNK UNK . END
the swirling sand made UNK limp more pronounced . END
they walked slowly past the UNK cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` UNK '' sign UNK in the wind . END
now they were in friendly territory . END
nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping UNK to the water's edge . END
his rock was to the right of a v-shaped inlet , a big , brown , UNK rock trailing UNK UNK . END
his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here . END
here he was enclosed and safe . END
( if a UNK or a sea monster came along , didn't he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a UNK ? ? END
here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe . END
he was UNK controlling the waves . END
he was a knight of the round table , `` sir UNK the brave '' , UNK evil spirits and UNK and UNK and witches with UNK noses . END
( one good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show . END
) he was the first UNK on the moon , chosen because of his small size and UNK nature . END
he was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and UNK would turn to . END
every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ? END
a dark bathroom can be pretty UNK , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : tomorrow , for sure , i'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad . END
he hadn't intended to make the promise . END
it happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to south america . END
every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; END
and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` stop screaming , quint . END
he could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the UNK of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar . END
`` let's talk about the beach . END
while i'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ? END
look , i can put two fingers between the UNK in the back of your neck . END
dr. UNK says swimming would help your leg . END
he says you're UNK more than you need to '' . END
`` how does he know ? ? END
he never had UNK '' . END
in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise UNK out . END
`` you just wait , dad . END
when you get back i'll UNK be swimming better than victoria . END
wait and see , dad '' . END
victoria was fourteen months younger than quint , a head taller , and could UNK any boy or girl on the beach . END
he called her `` UNK '' . END
she called him `` UNK -- that's why nobody plays with you , mister UNK '' . END
or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` please , lord UNK , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' . END
`` she's got a nerve '' . END
quint said now to the clouds . END
strength began to UNK up and down his chest . END
he felt strong as a giant . END
he UNK his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg . END
he UNK his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks . END
`` UNK , UNK '' , creaked a sea UNK . END
`` UNK , shut up '' , he said . END
he stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean . END
the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the UNK waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , UNK between the rocks and the waves . END
i can't go in . END
i'm scared of the nightmare . END
shivering , he put on his clothes . END
and shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water . END
`` watch it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back . END
she was holding on to his rock with one hand . END
she smelled of UNK . END
she wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no UNK on the UNK . END
`` why didn't you duck '' ? ? END
`` this is my rock '' . END
she was sore as a boil . END
`` ever hear of UNK rights '' ? ? END
they started with the UNK bill of eighteen '' -- END
`` mister big UNK , aren't you '' ? ? END
`` i'm mark gordon peters the fifth . END
they call me quint '' . END
`` then why don't you stop UNK '' ? ? END
`` i said quint . END
that's short for UNK . END
UNK in latin means '' -- END
`` i can speak both kinds of latin , smart UNK '' . END
her cough sounded like cloth UNK . END
`` you shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously UNK UNK UNK voice . END
`` i don't smoke '' . END
`` do you '' ? ? END
`` hell , yes '' . END
not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum . END
`` sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' . END
`` if i was your mama , i'd UNK your tail off '' . END
`` my mother never UNK me . END
i've got this leg brace '' . END
she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue UNK so she could see his brace . END
`` UNK '' , was what she said . END
`` why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ? ? END
`` because maybe i won't have to wear it always . END
dr. UNK says if i exercise my leg more , maybe i can use a cane when i'm big '' . END
she UNK a UNK of water into the air . END
`` a UNK mighty handy . END
someone's walking past , you want to stop him , UNK , UNK him around the neck with the UNK in your cane . END
or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is UNK , UNK your cane on the floor . END
hey , will you look at that '' ? ? END
maggie had shaken himself awake and was UNK the sand off his UNK UNK and his long UNK of a tail . END
`` that's some dog . END
what kind '' ? ? END
`` part UNK , part UNK terrier '' . END
he always did when people asked . END
`` holy UNK , that's the most unique dog i ever saw '' , she said firmly . END
`` his real name's dimaggio , only we call him maggie because he has to take tranquilizers . END
he's UNK than he looks . END
he's been sick lately . END
last tuesday he went on a ham UNK '' . END
`` a what '' ? ? END
he would have told her , but victoria was UNK . END
that meant `` mama wants you quint . END
come home or i'll come find you '' . END
`` i gotta go . END
even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes . END
i come early in the morning '' . END
`` so do i . END
see you around , mister UNK '' . END
that was how they started being friends . END
they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter . END
same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ; END
it made her UNK . END
her name was sabella , and the strip of UNK around her neck was an UNK UNK the king gave her as a token of his UNK love . END
`` you going to marry the king '' ? ? END
he's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork . END
my hair is what he's nuts about . END
naturally curly hair runs in my family . END
personally , i prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the continent , ' what can one do ' '' ? ? END
`` which continent '' ? ? END
`` name one , i been there '' . END
japan , she said , smelled UNK because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; END
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup . END
UNK in UNK had UNK . END
near UNK the UNK drove their UNK down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night . END
as for dancing -- holy UNK , he ought to see the UNK in UNK ; ; END
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them . END
quint smothered a UNK . END
she made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so . END
artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war ; ; END
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; END
that he personally had an UNK of UNK and was currently reading the UNK to UNK volume of the UNK . END
`` books are for UNK '' . END
she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear . END
nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as sabella . END
( `` what did one UNK say to the other UNK ? ? END
let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' . END
and `` what time did the UNK go to the dentist ? ? END
) encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham . END
he described the ham decorated with pineapple and UNK , cooling on the porch . END
he UNK up on the ham like maggie , UNK it with soft , UNK teeth , then panting with thirst , UNK up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` that does it . END
that dog has to go '' . END
`` say , you're quite a comic '' , sabella said UNK . END
`` ever thought about going on the stage '' ? ? END
but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head . END
`` either that or a UNK '' . END
`` better make up your mind , son '' , sabella said . END
`` you can't serve cod and UNK '' . END
she said UNK have no bones and UNK swam backward . END
his UNK agreed with sabella . END
next morning he tied a bunch of sea UNK with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around . END
boy , could she catch ! ! END
like willie mays in the UNK . END
`` nobody gave me flowers before . END
thank you , quint '' . END
her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough . END
`` you can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain UNK ne say UNK '' . END
sometimes they didn't talk at all . END
he UNK on the rock while she swam and UNK around . END
once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared . END
but victoria began UNK just then and he went home , carrying sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of UNK . END
as for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time . END
wednesday morning it happened . END
they were eating breakfast . END
`` we UNK thee , lord UNK , to bless this food '' -- that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed UNK toast on her plastic UNK . END
same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement . END
`` your UNK in san francisco '' , she told them . END
`` he says he'll be here on the UNK plane . END
fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ? END
`` yeah , keen '' . END
a cave seemed to be opening in UNK stomach . END
`` children , we'll have to get organized . END
the baby can have an early nap . END
victoria , i want you to -- '' END
quint closed the screen door quietly so maggie wouldn't be scared . END
`` hurry up , we're late '' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the UNK waves sending off sheets of blue and UNK green . END
the cave in his stomach hurt . END
he had to go into the water . END
he'd tell sabella about the nightmare . END
it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung . END
what caused it , he didn't know . END
the metal collar UNK his neck ? ? END
UNK so much ? ? END
the unbearable weight on his chest ? ? END
all of it together meant drowning . END
the first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second . END
when bobbie evans smashed up his car , the jaguar his wife linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an UNK golf at UNK , it seemed to mark the end of a long , UNK chapter in the social life of the community . END
linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath . END
not that linda was UNK , not that she would do anything UNK or in bad taste any more than john cooper would . END
hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? ? END
wasn't john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ? END
and wasn't john's wife , edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ? END
didn't john cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ? END
wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ? END
everybody knew that john cooper had married edythe on the UNK . END
it was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to john's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his . END
`` of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , mousie chandler said to linda stuart . END
`` poor john '' ! ! END
linda accepted the UNK , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the UNK mountains , and john was surely one of the UNK and brighter young men around pittsburgh . END
for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the UNK admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow UNK . END
john had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing UNK still around his eyes . END
you saw them always together those years . END
you talked about john-and-linda as an entity . END
john-and-linda were at UNK vue last night ; ; END
john-and-linda drove to UNK in three and a half hours . END
then there was a spat over something , as there had been UNK UNK before ; ; END
only this one didn't UNK . END
you still said `` john-and-linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or UNK . END
it got worse instead of better . END
first , it came out after mr. UNK will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that john and his mother weren't rich any more . END
and then there was UNK engagement to bobbie evans . END
there was no connection between the two events , because bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than john . END
he was a bright and handsome young man from new york , who worked for the same steel company as john did . END
some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action , but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe , with edythe his bride , it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . END
it wasn't even john and edythe . END
it was simply poor john . END
there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either . END
mousie chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at UNK . END
`` well , you shouldn't underestimate edythe '' , mousie said . END
`` i know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and UNK . END
she is frivolous and UNK , but she really isn't shallow '' . END
bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding . END
john was at the church with edythe . END
she UNK during the ceremony , and mousie chandler , who was one of UNK UNK , said john glared black as death at her . END
`` as if he were choking '' , she said . END
`` poor john '' ! ! END
edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example . END
her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length . END
she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at UNK vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart . END
and you didn't see her much at UNK vue or anywhere , for john had drifted away from the gang . END
mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity . END
others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda , mrs. bobbie evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything . END
there were UNK reasons too . END
john's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less cooper money left . END
john sold the big old place in UNK and bought a smaller house in fox chapel . END
he was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day . END
john was good at his job . END
it probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the UNK with nothing but edythe to come home to . END
though that may be unfair since ben cooper , john's first son , came along early in 1938 , the UNK baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all cooper from UNK to pink toes , UNK a trace of edythe . END
but the continuing charm of the other children -- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944 -- and all john's success at his work only made UNK UNK and general UNK more glaring . END
she never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired linda . END
when there was bridge at UNK house , the cards UNK like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . END
she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr. UNK , the eldest elder , who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what edythe called `` the UNK of the church '' . END
john did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually UNK , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . END
being an intelligent man , john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile . END
poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without UNK and maybe UNK over backward to keep a bad one . END
he was an attentive and generous husband , UNK , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him . END
but he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war ; ; END
after the war back to the heir UNK of the steel company . END
the UNK saw bobbie and linda socially , but no more than was necessary . END
bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match john's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the stuart money . END
he and linda settled down to being social leaders , and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year . END
and then came the UNK turn , the smashed jaguar and linda , mourning alone and lovely . END
everyone held his or her breath . END
`` don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time , if she'd tried '' , mousie gordon , who had been mousie chandler , said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le UNK . END
`` now you know she UNK , but she isn't that kind of girl . END
but now -- well , it would be a blessing , i think . END
linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed UNK death could move her to feeling . END
what she felt was a UNK loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death . END
she knew what people were thinking ; ; END
it was what she had been thinking herself . END
it was up to her to save poor john , dear john , to UNK the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the UNK of a cold stream . END
there was no one who would blame her or john ; ; END
she could be sure of that . END
it might be rough on edythe at first , but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to UNK her , to send her back to cleveland or anywhere . END
and linda felt capable of UNK the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and bobbie had had none of their own . END
it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of . END
linda would have to wait , she knew . END
but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ? END
years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead . END
of course , he had done wonders . END
UNK UNK and regular UNK had different sales departments at smith & UNK , where john and bobbie both worked . END
bobbie had been head of the UNK division , while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch . END
so when old mr. UNK , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular UNK had gone with UNK , it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie . END
for linda knew how to help her husband , not just the UNK contacts but also the little dinners for UNK UNK . END
she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job . END
`` what did you do '' ? ? END
`` you must have done something , something wrong . END
lord knows i had everything set for you '' . END
bobbie said something about damned UNK sticking together , and linda got angry at him . END
they had their first real fight , and bobbie went off to get drunk . END
linda UNK her uncle , donald UNK , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened . END
he was a director of s. & m. and must have been in on the decision . END
but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some UNK couldn't understand . END
he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other . END
`` i'm behind john cooper '' , mr. UNK said finally . END
`` i think we're agreed that he and evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive . END
`` now , i believe poor UNK work just a little harder . END
with that wife of his , i think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance . END
bobbie , with linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities . END
and also , the money can't mean as much to bobbie . END
`` bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ; END
poor john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us '' . END
most of the directors nodded . END
uncle donald UNK found himself nodding agreement too . END
after the surprise was over , linda was almost as pleased as anyone with john's good luck , though she agreed with UNK decision some months later to move to funk UNK . END
the job at funk wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement , since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of UNK family . END
poor john's rise continued to be UNK . END
when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future . END
she called then to say she had a UNK for that night . END
`` shirley appreciated the chance to make some money . END
such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' . END
`` that's swell '' , i said sweetly . END
i could get along without that three dollars . END
in some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing i was no longer obligated to nadine ! ! END
it was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang . END
i stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour . END
i answered to find nadine at the other end . END
`` you scared me half to death '' , i said UNK . END
`` what's wrong '' ? ? END
`` janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! ! END
her voice came shrill . END
`` i'm absolutely frantic ! ! END
that stupid girl might have gone off and left francie '' ! ! END
`` oh , she wouldn't do that '' , i said . END
`` she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone . END
but if you're worried you can go home and check '' -- END
`` i can't leave the party ! ! END
we're at ken UNK apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! ! END
old mr. thom is already down on wally , and we simply can't afford to get ken mad at us '' -- END
i was all set for what came next . END
`` janice , could you possibly go over and make sure UNK all right ? ? END
i'll call you there in ten minutes '' -- END
`` i can't make it in ten minutes '' -- wondering , as i said it , why i should make it at all . END
why should i go over at midnight to check on francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ? END
`` fifteen minutes , then ! ! END
i'll be glad to pay you '' -- END
so sure that money could do anything ! ! END
`` all right '' , i said . END
not for the dollar or so nadine would give me . END
but because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if i didn't go over , who would ? ? END
chris was sound asleep , and i didn't see any sense in waking him . END
i dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened . END
i drove off through the cool darkness to UNK apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door . END
her face was flushed from sleep . END
`` it's all right '' , i said , as she started to look scared . END
`` mrs. roberts had called , and couldn't wake you . END
i just came over to make sure everything was all right '' . END
`` i'm -- hard to wake up '' , she UNK . END
she didn't look over thirteen . END
and nadine insisted that her UNK be reliable ! ! END
`` i have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on . END
`` i didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! ! END
the phone started ringing . END
`` that's mrs. roberts again '' , i said . END
`` i'll answer it '' . END
i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone . END
i told nadine everything was fine , and that i'd be getting on home . END
`` janice , would you mind staying '' ? ? END
there was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying . END
`` UNK drunk -- i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can , but i don't want shirley to see him like this . END
you know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' -- END
not a word of thanks for what i'd already done . END
the receiver clicked in my ear . END
she didn't even give me a chance to refuse . END
well , there wasn't any law that said i had to stay ! ! END
but then i looked at shirley and thought that i might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with wally coming home drunk . END
so i told her mrs. roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment . END
after i looked in at francie , i went into the living room and waited . END
i must have dozed off , because i came to with a start at the sound of voices . END
UNK , shrill with anger -- UNK loud and thick -- as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two . END
i opened the door , and wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if nadine had pushed him . END
i had always thought she was so beautiful . END
but now she looked ugly . END
her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , wally would have been dead . END
`` pack your clothes '' , she UNK . END
`` pack -- and get out '' ! ! END
`` you're crazy '' , wally said thickly . END
he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep . END
nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face . END
i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right , and she was crazy . END
`` you stay out of this '' , she spat at me . END
`` he's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! ! END
he UNK ken thom '' ! ! END
her eyes were wild . END
`` he told ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! ! END
and the other people there were listening ! ! END
we're ruined and he's going to get out if i have to throw him down the stairs '' -- END
`` you'd better simmer down '' , i said UNK . END
i was plenty scared . END
in the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! ! END
`` now you just take it easy , and i'll make you some tea '' -- END
`` tea , '' nadine UNK . END
`` how can you be so damn stupid ? ? END
UNK lost his job ! ! END
ken will never forgive him -- never ! ! END
and we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime ! ! END
all we own is UNK bedroom set and the UNK player and we even owe on them . END
and we'll be poor and have to live in a UNK little house like yours -- and all because of that '' -- END
i clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of UNK . END
`` stop that ! ! END
you'll wake up the whole building . END
wally can't go any place at this hour '' -- END
`` well then , i'll get out '' -- but she looked uncertain . END
she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go UNK off anywhere at two in the morning . END
`` you go to bed '' , i said UNK . END
`` in the morning you and wally can talk things out '' -- END
she collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped . END
i got her into bed , and sat with her until she had UNK herself out . END
it was three o'clock before i figured it was all right to go . END
i left her , a limp bundle of UNK , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her . END
wally was snoring on the davenport . END
i had done all i could . END
i had done all i was going to do . END
whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine . END
i drove home , found chris still asleep . END
i snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him . END
thankful i wasn't nadine . END
i kept on being thankful . END
in the afternoon nadine and wally came over with francie . END
wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry . END
`` i'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why i drank so much . END
i -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' -- END
old mr. thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , wally confessed , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired . END
seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side . END
mr. thom had gotten wally on the phone , and fired him . END
`` i thought i'd smooth things over through ken '' , wally said UNK . END
`` but ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises . END
and i was plastered and i blew my stack '' -- END
`` and told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! ! END
i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there . END
but she was beyond caring what she said . END
`` things may smooth over yet '' , chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern . END
but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved . END
now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough . END
when a bubble breaks , there's nothing . END
little by little , during the week , chris and i discovered the crazy unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived . END
they had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their UNK , owing on everything they owned . END
on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day wally received written notice that he was fired , they were UNK . END
worst of all , wally had no training for any kind of work . END
he had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded . END
`` i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' . END
i said i wished we were , too . END
it was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent . END
but chris UNK up like a candle . END
`` i'm glad you feel that way , honey . END
there is one big way we can help them . END
we can let them move in with us '' -- END
something i had simply never thought of . END
i just stared at him . END
it was incredible -- he gave me an embarrassed , pleading look . END
`` i know we'd be pretty crowded . END
but it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' . END
straightened out -- they'd had years of making all that money ! ! END
`` i won't do it '' , i said flatly . END
`` nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! ! END
well , now she can sleep in the street for all i care '' ! ! END
`` that isn't like you , janice '' , chris said UNK . END
then i felt uncomfortable , too . END
i didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter . END
but , UNK it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled UNK who had looked down their noses at us ? ? END
but , in the end , we did . END
it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do . END
the finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name . END
then wally got sick . END
to my way of thinking , he was scared sick . END
his luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world . END
chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of UNK nadine had bought on special . END
at least we'll eat , i thought grimly as i put all the food away . END
while i worked , nadine sat and cried . END
when she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with wally . END
`` virus infection nothing '' , she'd scream at him . END
`` you're too lazy to go out and look for another job . END
you're just a UNK bum '' ! ! END
it was a mess , all right . END
but it couldn't go on forever -- a couple of weeks , chris had said . END
i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks . END
but the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us . END
UNK constant nagging had finally gotten wally out of bed . END
he set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of UNK and UNK . END
wendell thom had UNK him . END
nobody would even take his application . END
`` you can get something , '' nadine would snap . END
`` you can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else '' . END
`` the high school kids have got everything UNK up '' , he said , a whine in his voice . END
`` those damn UNK -- taking work away from men who need it '' . END
`` by fall they'll be back in school '' , i'd say , trying to sound encouraging . END
but this was only the middle of july . END
and i couldn't take six more weeks of this . END
i mentioned it to chris one UNK hot night , when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air . END
i don't really believe in intuition . END
but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes , i knew it was going to be a bad day . END
part of it was the weather , so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital . END
part of it was being so tired -- i'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late . END
but the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all . END
it was just going to be one of those days . END
for the UNK time , i wished i'd chosen some nice , UNK , UNK profession . END
and for the UNK time , i answered myself . END
i hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me . END
actually , i shouldn't complain , i told myself in the shaving mirror . END
i had a lot to be thankful for . END
a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be UNK at . END
maybe i didn't see as much of gladdy as i'd like , but how much worse it would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice went -- send my daughter to an UNK or a UNK . END
at least , we were together and we had mrs. hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be UNK of gladdy than mrs. hodges was . END
i was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . END
especially in the way gladdy had turned out . END
growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother alice had been . END
but i mustn't start on alice . END
she is a closed book , a picture i keep on my bureau , but never look at . END
if she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story i'd told gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow END
as usual , UNK bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table . END
her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me . END
it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too . END
oh , i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision . END
i had a feeling that young pete UNK , the most promising UNK at UNK , had something to do with it , too . END
she'd been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little . END
but once i was alone again , driving to the hospital , the UNK returned . END
if she and pete were really getting serious , i'd have to do some hard thinking . END
should i tell him the truth about alice ? ? END
did he have a right to know the secret i'd kept from gladdy all these years ? ? END
the boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to UNK . END
two UNK and dick UNK , the other resident . END
i'm chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds . END
pete was down on seven , dick told me , and he'd meet us there . END
there wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one UNK than they should have been . END
pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven -- he'd had a case of UNK shock , but it was all taken care of now . END
seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then . END
when we'd finished our regular rounds , pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor . END
`` got a new one in last night '' , he said . END
`` i haven't seen her yet , but i hear she's a UNK '' ! ! END
the ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics . END
we didn't get many at UNK and they were never pretty sights . END
it was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward . END
the moment i walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed . END
they'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk . END
but there was something about her -- and i felt my lips forming a name . END
alice but this woman's name was rose bancroft ! ! END
i looked at the chart for reassurance . END
yes , rose bancroft , diagnosis : acute UNK . END
she looked about sixty , though i recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four . END
an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar UNK face , already marred by the UNK network of broken red veins that heavy UNK carry . END
her coarse hair was UNK -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray . END
oh , could it be ? ? END
no , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and i turned to dick , forcing myself to put my UNK out of my mind . END
in a low voice , dick filled us in END
she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway . END
although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out . END
it was the old story . END
we'd keep her a day or two , and the UNK people would talk to her . END
but if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left . END
turning toward the patient again , i -- i can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that i felt sick . END
i tell you , it took every UNK of control i had to be able to speak . END
`` now , miss -- or is it mrs. bancroft '' ? ? END
i never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it UNK them , i've always thought , to chat first . END
this was one time i'd have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong . END
`` hey '' ! ! END
her voice was flat and dull . END
but those penetrating eyes -- i had to turn my head away . END
it was then that i saw what the UNK covers revealed . END
there were UNK on the sheet . END
`` what's this '' ? ? END
`` your period '' ? ? END
she shook her head . END
`` i been UNK a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice . END
`` have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ? END
once again , there was a negative shake . END
i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table . END
`` better do a UNK '' , i told pete . END
it was only a few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination . END
pete stood by with a slide and took the UNK , sent it down to the UNK with a request for the test . END
that done , i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind . END
i was busy the rest of the day . END
late in the afternoon , i was up on seven again . END
one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled . END
on my way to the elevator , i ran into pete . END
`` i've got the results on the bancroft UNK test '' , he said . END
`` there's something there , all right . END
class three , they said . END
do you want to talk to her , doctor '' ? ? END
`` well '' -- i didn't -- i didn't ever want to see that woman again . END
but that was ridiculous , of course . END
we'll do a d. and c. and get her permission for a UNK . END
maybe it's nothing , maybe it's UNK or in UNK -- can't take any chances '' . END
`` if you can keep her here that long '' , pete said UNK . END
`` groggins tells me she's started UNK already , wants to get out . END
wants to get to her booze , i guess '' . END
i UNK in distaste . END
`` well , better see what i can do '' . END
we'd been standing right outside miss UNK door and as i went to turn the UNK to enter , i was surprised to find that the door was slightly UNK . END
but she seemed to be UNK and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones . END
her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , i felt an inward shiver . END
`` i sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said . END
`` i just got through seeing one of you guys . END
what do you want '' ? ? END
there was something almost insulting in her tone , but i disregarded it . END
`` i've just been talking to dr. UNK '' , i said . END
`` we'd like you to have a UNK and UNK . END
that's quite minor , nothing to worry about . END
but we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary '' . END
it was flat , definite . END
`` suppose you let me explain . END
actually , i rather doubt that we'll have to do this . END
even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' . END
i was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor . END
i looked at her in amazement . END
i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why . END
mostly , it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the UNK . END
`` will you tell me why '' ? ? END
she smiled , a smile without humor . END
`` you shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said . END
`` i've got cancer , haven't i '' ? ? END
she went on , UNK my protests . END
`` i'm not going to be one of your UNK pigs . END
let your pupils learn on someone else , doctor . END
just let me die in peace '' . END
i stared at her , almost UNK . END
her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was . END
even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone . END
this was someone who'd come down in the world , i thought . END
a long , long way down . END
again there was something familiar about her , something -- END
`` you haven't got cancer '' , i said as strongly as i could . END
`` i don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but i assure you i don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? ? END
and even if '' -- END
`` don't give me a lot of talk , joe '' . END
i UNK at her . END
she could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult . END
but there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke . END
she was watching me intently , a funny little UNK on her lips . END
`` surprised , baby ? ? END
guess i've changed , haven't i ? ? END
but you haven't changed much , joe '' . END
i knew then , knew with a UNK shock . END
`` alice '' -- i stammered through dry lips . END
`` alice , for goodness sake '' -- END
`` alice '' , she echoed UNK . END
`` what's the matter , joe , you scared of me ? ? END
think i'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ? END
well , don't worry . END
just let me UNK here '' -- END
`` but why did you come back '' ? ? END
i'd found my voice . END
`` where have you been all these years '' ? ? END
`` here and there . END
as for coming back here -- well , i'll tell you the truth , i didn't even know where i was when i came to . END
the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego '' -- END
the way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her UNK blackout , made me shudder . END
and this was UNK mother ! ! END
`` i never asked you for any favors , joe '' , she went on , `` but i'm asking one now . END
let me UNK here ! ! END
you doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ? END
no , i want out , joe '' ! ! END
i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . END
let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ? END
what she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me . END
if i let her go , she'd disappear once more . END
and gladdy would be safe ! ! END
i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea . END
she made me welcome . END
her dark cool caresses were UNK than any woman's ; ; END
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i breathed into a nitrogen UNK . END
UNK , she UNK me , and drew me deeper into her . END
i no longer knew how deep i was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting UNK , happier and more contented by the second . END
the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now . END
only the dive itself had any meaning . END
the UNK nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water . END
perhaps if i took off the UNK i could swim better , love my woman better . END
i chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out . END
while a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time . END
it was when i packed up what UNK i had and went to paris . END
it was no vacation , just me getting out after a UNK . END
i knew it wouldn't be the same . END
wild UNK never are , but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind . END
once before i had been to paris , long before i married UNK . END
that first time was good and it stuck with me . END
i was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at UNK instead of UNK . END
it was a saturday evening in april with a UNK rain , and i was a little high on the good taste of life . END
i had a UNK of money , which was unusual when i was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night . END
in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the UNK UNK in a fresh uniform . END
i felt like a UNK in rome . END
all the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; END
everything was glamorous to my UNK eyes . END
there were some sweet machines other than women : an old UNK , a lean UNK UNK on an american UNK , a swallow , a type UNK UNK and lots more . END
there was the arc de UNK and the tour UNK -- i was no UNK , but i was young , and this was paris ! ! END
i had champagne at UNK , then went into a cafe called the jour et UNK to ask the way to UNK . END
i never got there . END
i met claire , which was better . END
she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine . END
i didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful . END
she was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress . END
maybe her UNK eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it . END
when she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : END
`` handsome soldier , i have UNK one hunger with food . END
i feel another of terrible urgency . END
is your evening free '' ? ? END
`` madame '' , i said with UNK UNK because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' . END
and so off we went to her apartment . END
she was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl . END
toward the break of day i waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese . END
now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned . END
i got there on a saturday evening . END
i made the mistake of going to the jour et UNK . END
the place was busy but i didn't feel like a UNK . END
i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up . END
i had part of a bottle of french beer called UNK UNK ( so help me ) , then switched to UNK . END
after a few hours , life hadn't showed , and i was UNK . END
i went to my hotel and slept . END
the next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning ? ? END
so i drank more cognac . END
all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space . END
i read the UNK of UNK and the UNK of cancer . END
elemental , but sex . END
that's what was on my mind . END
i was turning over the idea of a good UNK when i dozed off . END
i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up . END
my head was clear , my thinking sober and i was UNK to this paris idea as a UNK on top of all my others . END
a good UNK has that kind of therapeutic value . END
sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing . END
i went out into it . END
i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park , and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky . END
there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night . END
i had on only a UNK , but i wasn't cold . END
i was just miserable . END
pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick . END
she saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away . END
suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella . END
it gave her poise and posture . END
without it she would have been drab and limp . END
it gave her propriety . END
it gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle . END
i couldn't imagine her without it . END
i knew all about her . END
she was another human being and happened to be a hustler . END
i didn't much care if she were there or not . END
after a while she said with sort of an UNK laugh , `` you have snow in your hair and ears '' . END
( i didn't have on a hat . END
hardly glancing at her , i smiled a bleak one which said , thanks , baby , but i'd rather be alone . END
she was silent for a while , then said , `` why are you so unhappy '' ? ? END
`` i'm not unhappy '' , i lied , staring at the snow . END
she was trying to make a hole in my armor , and i didn't want it . END
`` is it a woman '' ? ? END
she must have seen the ring on my left hand . END
`` well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , i observed profoundly , adding , `` you can UNK your UNK on that '' . END
`` ah , monsieur , it is not my business to UNK it . END
this took me so funny i had to look at her . END
i felt my frozen sad face UNK , and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have helped . END
i even UNK a chuckle . END
she smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile . END
she was even more miserable than me . END
her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was UNK and infinite wisdom in them . END
`` now isn't it better to smile '' ? ? END
because i liked this sad person so much , i said , `` will you have a drink with me '' ? ? END
i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same UNK . END
anyway , i pulled a bottle of UNK martin out of my UNK , drew the cork , and passed it to her . END
i could see she was shocked . END
`` i'm sorry i haven't got a glass '' , i said . END
`` non , non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' . END
she tilted up and drank , and then i drank . END
it's really UNK to drink good cognac like that , but i hadn't cared before . END
i wasn't going to UNK around a glass . END
there wasn't much light in the blue dark , but i could see her well . END
no child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty . END
i couldn't be sure . END
somehow she was attractive . END
not good looking , but UNK and wise so that it made her attractive . END
i liked her , and all at once i was glad she was there . END
we finished the bottle -- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober . END
i suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it . END
we seemed to be UNK , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell . END
then she said , `` UNK '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word . END
i sensed no stranger in her . END
we UNK and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with UNK . END
i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age . END
she had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side . END
i think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the UNK had melted . END
i felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy . END
my head was clear . END
i was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital . END
`` UNK jour '' , i said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . END
she looked good , with her short UNK hair and no make-up . END
maybe closer to thirty , i thought . END
`` UNK jour '' ! ! END
she exclaimed , smiling . END
`` UNK UNK '' ! ! END
`` yeah , but breakfast first '' . END
with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom . END
i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her . END
she came out pink from a hot bath , and i gave her my robe . END
i had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast . END
`` the toothbrush monsieur '' , he said , presenting it . END
i gave it to the woman . END
`` what is this for '' ? ? END
`` why , to brush your teeth '' . END
`` but i already have ! ! END
i used yours '' . END
`` oh '' ? ? END
i said with round eyes . END
i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself . END
but i smelled the coffee , and thinking , what the hell , live UNK , i decided i would UNK my worries away . END
the coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good . END
we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot UNK eggs and hot garlic bread . END
as we ate , we talked . END
her name was UNK , and mine stephen . END
we sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee . END
`` you are very UNK , do you know , stephen '' , she remarked . END
`` um '' ? ? END
i grunted , sipping . END
`` yes , because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush '' . END
i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror . END
`` i didn't really use yours '' , she went on . END
`` i carry one in my purse . END
i know men never kiss UNK UNK '' . END
to my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` shall we go to the UNK today '' ? ? END
`` all right '' . END
i said with enthusiasm at the idea . END
`` but not immediately '' . END
i put aside my empty cup . END
she smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own . END
we were not rushed . END
`` what is this from '' ? ? END
i asked , touching the scar on her stomach . END
it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle . END
`` a bullet '' , she answered . END
the cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all . END
she understood sex anyway , and played at it well . END
we went to the UNK for a few hours , then by UNK to a UNK in UNK . END
it was a nice place , not filled with smoke . END
we had champagne and steamed UNK . END
the UNK brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered . END
he must have thought i was a tourist . END
i fixed him with a UNK eye and said , `` what's this for ? ? END
i didn't ask for a UNK of champagne '' . END
i thought that was pretty humorous , but i didn't laugh . END
two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield : she put them in her bag . END
she would not stop to read them in american express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street . END
this was her first day in rome and it was june . END
an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead . END
in her mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost UNK , to these UNK peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , UNK on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , UNK and UNK , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills . END
pictures in old latin books returned to her : the UNK way today , the UNK , the arch of constantine . END
she would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight . END
moreover , nursing various stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy UNK ( everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick ) , theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot . END
england , france , germany , switzerland , and italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and UNK , she had conceived a dreamy passion by UNK , to see all these places with her own eyes . END
the very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : now i can go . END
there's nothing to stop me now . END
so here it was , here was italy , anyway , and terribly noisy . END
in the street the traffic was really frightening . END
cars , UNK , buses , and UNK all went UNK at once down the narrow length of it or UNK UNK around a fountain . END
UNK of tourists went by her in national groups -- english school girls in blue uniforms , german boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows . END
glad to be alone , theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left . END
something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of UNK plants . END
she had heard about it the night before at her hotel . END
it was not yet complete : workmen were unloading the UNK plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above . END
the UNK were as large as shrubs , and their myriad UNK , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through UNK and rose to the UNK pink , along with many white ones too . END
marvelous , thought theresa , climbing in her UNK , UNK way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything . END
in rome , all over europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed . END
halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down . END
other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide UNK and leaning over the UNK above , watching the UNK mass , or just enjoying the sun . END
theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing mediterranean air . END
the sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches . END
she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette . END
how could you be both at once ? ? END
strange , but she was . END
presently , she picked up the first of the letters . END
a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay . END
of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! ! END
poor cousin elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? ? END
and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway ? ? END
she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her . END
her cousin emma UNK had written it , in her loose high old lady's script -- UNK carefully crossed , but UNK inclined to UNK like an old car on the downward slope . END
cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield , rome , italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka , alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her UNK neighbor . END
no return address whatsoever . END
somebody had scrawled american express , piazza di UNK ? ? END
, across the envelope , and now theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope . END
inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of cousin alexander UNK . END
cousin emma and cousin elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time UNK until the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago . END
two days before he was taken sick , cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his UNK , and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a UNK paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died . END
i'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . END
this letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome , italy , on it . END
she UNK the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother george . END
but alas george , when he had written , had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin UNK funeral . END
he was full of heavy family UNK . END
all the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today . END
his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in UNK ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all . END
a life of UNK and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand . END
the only boy , the family darling . END
together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong . END
theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various UNK of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , anne , had not seemed to understand poor george . END
could it just be , theresa wondered , that anne had understood only too well , and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ? END
as for cousin alexander UNK , the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at cousin UNK call -- first papa , then mother , then theresa and george . END
there they all did their UNK to help cousin elec get a UNK out of his foot . END
he had UNK downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his UNK , on a UNK . END
he held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his UNK face -- he was trying UNK not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey . END
they all surrounded him , the family circle , theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and cousin emma running back and forth with a UNK of hot water which she poured steaming into a white UNK pan . END
`` can you think of anything to do '' ? ? END
`` i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up i'll just have to ! ! END
can you think of anything to do '' ? ? END
`` you might treat it like the UNK '' , said papa . END
`` drop a cold key down his back '' . END
`` i just hope this happens to you someday '' , said cousin elec , who was not at his best . END
`` poor cousin elec '' , george said . END
he was younger than theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not UNK . END
`` poor cousin elec '' . END
now , here they both were , still the same , george full of UNK woe , and cousin emma in despair . END
theresa shifted to a new page . END
`` of course ( UNK letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered . END
cousin emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it . END
UNK and UNK tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here , but i think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our UNK is still in high school . END
the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with -- miss UNK UNK , for example . END
but there is more in this than meets the eye . END
a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in . END
the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally UNK off . END
'' ( theresa skipped a page of details about the house . END
) `` i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . END
i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best . END
i really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought theresa , it always makes me sick . END
i'll start UNK in a minute , sitting on these cold steps . END
she got up , standing UNK for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . END
they wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to american eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked UNK black and slick . END
yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so . END
just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap UNK , parker fountain UNK , UNK , papal portraits . END
`` no '' , said theresa . END
`` no , no '' ! ! END
the man did not wish to leave . END
he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them . END
UNK rides in the park , the UNK by moonlight , he specialized . END
theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two . END
there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the UNK picked himself another UNK american lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone . END
was he ever successful , theresa wondered . END
the lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; END
at last , alarm . END
she cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! ! END
finally , she UNK away up the steps . END
theresa stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin UNK death and `` doing something '' about cousin emma . END
they were even , anne and george , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not UNK that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in august to get cousin UNK house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september . END
of course , it wasn't anne and UNK fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without theresa ? ? END
the trouble is , theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist . END
they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow . END
it never registered with them that i had time to read all of UNK , dickens , and UNK while papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after mother's operation . END
it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes of elsie UNK . END
she arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other . END
then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two . END
`` UNK '' ? ? END
she became aware that two italian workmen , carrying a large UNK pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display . END
`` UNK UNK , UNK , ma UNK . END
`` oh put it there '' ! ! END
she indicated a spot a little distance away . END
i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield -- that lucille was a husband UNK . END
you can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only UNK . END
and i've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its lucille warren . END
just as it has its susan UNK , though UNK ever bothered to tell me that . END
susan UNK , that's me . END
they even talked about lucille down at the young UNK league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission . END
i never heard my folks talk about her , though . END
they were UNK religious people , and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody . END
even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren , i know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me . END
my folks and my faith protected me from things like that . END
and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs. warren . END
i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck . END
i asked him if it was true . END
he gave me a straight , honest answer . END
`` look , sue baby '' , he'd said . END
much as i love you -- well , a UNK a guy and UNK willing to -- to come across . END
honest , kitten , that's all it is -- i don't even like lucille much '' . END
i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren . END
but it didn't seem fair . END
my love for johnnie was young and clean -- how could i possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex . END
johnnie was a UNK with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line . END
it was a vivid , sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff dad had ordered . END
i wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment i saw johnnie , i knew he was different . END
he wasn't only different -- he was it . END
he had an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that i had sometimes admired in other older men . END
his smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp . END
the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too . END
i could hardly believe such good luck was mine . END
and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him . END
i guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on johnnie , my johnnie . END
i didn't like it one bit . END
but what could i do ? ? END
a man had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and i wasn't providing it for johnnie . END
neither was his wife . END
she wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her . END
but he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will . END
and he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that . END
he was too honorable to leave his wife UNK and leave those helpless children without their daddy . END
johnnie loved me and wanted me . END
but the only love i was giving him was the pure kind . END
it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time . END
against my UNK wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck . END
the rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked . END
but by the time the first UNK of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love . END
yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little . END
`` it's so crazy '' , i told him once . END
`` i always imagined i would probably end up UNK a minister or somebody like that . END
somebody with no vices . END
`` and you fall for a lumber jockey '' . END
`` who drinks far too much '' . END
`` and UNK too much '' . END
`` and '' , i was UNK off the items on my fingers , `` UNK too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' . END
he examined his nails carefully . END
`` i could walk out the door '' . END
`` don't you dare '' . END
`` and never show my face or my truck around here again '' . END
he still wasn't looking at me . END
`` you wouldn't '' . END
`` or i could visit lucille warren '' . END
`` i might '' . END
and now he was seeing her . END
he'd just admitted it to me . END
i huddled UNK beside him in the truck . END
it was all my doing -- his seeing her . END
johnnie and i had been innocent in our love , and that was the way i wanted to keep it . END
at first , johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ? END
but then he had said , `` all right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' . END
but what had i done , trying to keep us pure ? ? END
i had driven him into the arms of that UNK woman . END
i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil ! ! END
so one week later , i surrendered to him in the little motel on route 10 . END
my very first time . END
i was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the UNK of lucille warren . END
and , though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered . END
i wanted him , with a terrifying UNK . END
astonishingly enough , it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me . END
`` love me , johnnie '' . END
`` i will , kitten '' ! ! END
outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand UNK UNK us . END
`` will you always love me this way '' ? ? END
and i snuggled closer to the man i loved . END
it was as blissful and UNK a night as any bride ever experienced . END
i had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but i had all the joy that goes with them . END
`` it can't be wrong , can it ? ? END
johnnie rose on one elbow . END
it's never wrong if love is real '' . END
i took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness . END
infinite peace , complete UNK . END
UNK delight , i later discovered . END
i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious UNK . END
i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about . END
i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love , and so in a way i was keeping my promise to god , my promise to remain pure until i was married . END
i was practically a bride , after all . END
there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible . END
of this , i had no doubt . END
wouldn't johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ? END
of course he would . END
he'd not only told me so , he'd proved it . END
it wasn't UNK fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable . END
just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too . END
and if i could contribute to that , i'd do it . END
the cost didn't matter . END
no price is too high when true love is at stake . END
and i had no doubts about how true this love was . END
i'd never even UNK with a boy , and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until i all but threw myself at him . END
he was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and i figured that , emotionally , i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half . END
what could a mere twelve years matter ? ? END
it wasn't , i was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity . END
and hadn't i rescued him from lucille warren ? ? END
she'd have gotten him , if i hadn't stopped her . END
after all , lucille warren was a UNK from way back . END
but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the UNK love we shared . END
it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring . END
`` love me '' ? ? END
`` always and always , johnnie '' ? ? END
convention time in boston . END
a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow . END
from the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the young UNK league , and i'd been chosen to represent our chapter . END
i had mixed emotions about going . END
i'd been seeing johnnie almost a year now , but i still didn't want to leave him for five whole days . END
but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group . END
i hadn't been doing as much work as i used to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever . END
i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group . END
so i went to boston . END
the first meeting was held in UNK hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states . END
my cousin alma , at whose home i was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island . END
one of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named ronald , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes . END
he looked very different from johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me . END
i thought so , and he mentioned it , and alma said so too . END
after the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone's house . END
i assumed alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated . END
outside the hall , i anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow . END
`` hey , there , beautiful twin of mine '' , ronald said . END
`` need a UNK to get to the party '' ? ? END
i couldn't help laughing with him . END
`` well , i should find alma '' -- i began . END
`` alma , UNK . END
come along with me '' . END
by the time we arrived , the party was already going strong . END
a couple of the girls were laughing rather UNK and i realized they were drinking . END
my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with johnnie . END
i hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning . END
but when johnnie disguised the taste with UNK UNK , i enjoyed it . END
of course i enjoyed UNK anything if i did it with johnnie . END
johnnie i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening . END
but that was only natural , i decided ; ; END
surely he was still resting UNK in my heart . END
`` i don't see alma anywhere '' , i said . END
`` she's invisible tonight . END
c'mon , let's find out where they're keeping the glasses '' . END
`` i -- i don't think so , ronald . END
not for me '' . END
`` UNK , come on '' . END
`` no -- really '' . END
but at least come along while i get UNK '' . END
the kitchen was jammed . END
strange faces , most of them , and i wasn't even sure all of them had come from the league meeting . END
under normal circumstances , he had a certain UNK UNK charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs . END
today , he looked like an UNK who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach . END
breakfast , he thought . END
a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better . END
he looked around his little eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , UNK stove . END
`` you share a refrigerator '' , mrs. kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from new york in UNK rain , that had sounded reasonable . END
in the cold light of day , it seemed a UNK arrangement . END
share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ? END
she had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units . END
and where was the thing ? ? END
he remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of UNK UNK . END
ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda '' between unit number three and unit number four . END
it was still raining , and mrs. UNK cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and UNK . END
charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day . END
this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it . END
`` take a full month '' , the doctor had said . END
`` lots of sun , lots of rest . END
the red pills are a UNK compound . END
this is a sleeping capsule . END
the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked . END
you young men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly '' . END
charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment . END
the doctor could call it anything from flu to UNK ; ; END
but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it . END
he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on . END
he had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women . END
once burned -- UNK , really , because vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy . END
from now on , his was going to be a man's world : the north woods , duck UNK at UNK , beer and poker and male secretaries . END
meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy UNK at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow UNK . END
in these damp circumstances , he was an UNK bet to develop UNK . END
he looked up to see mrs. kirby , awesome in a UNK UNK UNK , bearing down on him . END
`` UNK blow '' ! ! END
he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of UNK victory over the tourists . END
`` fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added . END
`` i hope so '' , he said . END
`` i've got this cold . END
thought i'd bake it out in the sun '' . END
she studied him briefly . END
`` you've got a peaked look . END
better get in out of the wet '' . END
charlie UNK to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , UNK being less than UNK . END
as for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with vivian lost to him forever . END
he could imagine her at this minute , UNK in nassau with UNK , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of UNK bliss . END
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long . END
he UNK through the light reading provided by mrs. kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the UNK twins ( at the seashore , at the mountains , on the farm , and in danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of UNK disease in cattle , UNK illustrated . END
he dozed , only to dream of vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , UNK his other UNK . END
he took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . END
his first thought was that mrs. kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; END
but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the UNK variety that sheds onto men's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . END
he thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . END
next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator . END
`` would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ? END
`` the smell UNK everything '' ! ! END
everything being the sweater , a UNK case , and a UNK bottle of UNK UNK pink hand lotion . END
the note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and UNK and utterly feminine . END
not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol . END
he scrawled `` sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` don't you eat '' ? ? END
he didn't want to encourage anything here ; ; END
but on the other hand , he didn't want her UNK his salami . END
`` not onions '' , came the answer the following day . END
must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater UNK . END
but then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense . END
yes , take vivian . END
now , if this were vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink . END
they would be black or white or UNK UNK , chic and UNK , like vivian herself . END
pink , vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy . END
`` why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? ? END
it was mrs. kirby , making her UNK way along the veranda , laden with a UNK collection of UNK , brushes , and pails . END
`` what's that you say '' ? ? END
`` oh , nothing . END
just glad the UNK stopped '' . END
`` oh , yes . END
just look at that sky . END
be a UNK by afternoon '' . END
`` i hope so . END
i've got this cold '' . END
`` so you said '' . END
`` my , you're peaked . END
you want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day . END
i must remember to warn the girl next to you in UNK . END
that pale UNK the worst '' . END
that pale kind , charlie thought . END
hardly an inviting description . END
but then , neither was peaked . END
he could hear mrs. kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn . END
`` i spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say . END
`` he's that peaked kind '' . END
surely there was a better word . END
charlie looked in the mirror . END
he looked more closely . END
frail , feeble -- peaked . END
clearly , two damp days with the UNK twins had done him no good . END
the sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to mrs. UNK UNK properties . END
when charlie came up from the beach for his UNK pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a UNK modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community UNK . END
this weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with cape roses , maybe , at the door . END
he could not imagine a UNK being brave enough to grow beside UNK , UNK , and the rest . END
the sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes . END
no wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes . END
he got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` be my guest '' on the wrapping . END
it gave him a good feeling . END
thanks '' , was her answer the next day . END
the note was UNK against his pill bottles and bore a UNK : `` you're not at all well , are you '' ? ? END
`` i've got this cold '' , he wrote . END
not that it was any of her business . END
`` it's none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be UNK . END
i mean , she's still living , and she's UNK . END
why don't you try that '' ? ? END
`` i don't have a lemon '' . END
he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper . END
by the next morning , she had turned the paper over . END
`` gee , neither do i '' . END
she didn't sound like a pale girl . END
she sounded a little like a redhead . END
but then , UNK are often pale . END
he stuck his head in mrs. UNK little rental office . END
`` i guess that redhead next to me took your advice . END
i haven't seen her on the beach '' . END
`` you won't , if you're looking for a redhead . END
she's got UNK hair '' . END
he spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , UNK girl in a pink bathing suit . END
there were pink bathing suits on UNK , and UNK girls in red or black or green bathing suits . END
there were a sprinkling of daring UNK and a UNK of glorified tank suits . END
up on a UNK , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting . END
he paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , UNK sweaters . END
on the beach , there were pale girls and UNK girls . END
and he saw them all as he walked up and down . END
at two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down UNK , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , UNK beach . END
finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , UNK her hand lotion , and left a note . END
`` i've got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and i used some of your hand lotion . END
hope you don't mind '' . END
`` of course i don't mind '' , she answered . END
`` you're having a miserable time , aren't you ? ? END
use all the lotion you want , and for UNK sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' . END
this was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided . END
sympathy is a fine quality in a woman . END
now vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy . END
she felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; END
it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own . END
he didn't know what was so tough about UNK world , UNK around nassau with UNK . END
suppose UNK got a sunburn ? ? END
charlie couldn't see vivian offering any hand lotion . END
she might UNK him , once the worst of the agony was over . END
charlie spent the next two days in his UNK bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to UNK , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion . END
correspondence passed back and forth . END
`` how's your sunburn now ? ? END
the only thing , this lotion has UNK in it , and that UNK the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it '' . END
`` i'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' . END
`` that mrs. kirby ! ! END
i'll bet she told you i was puny , too . END
how's your cold '' ? ? END
she didn't say you were puny . END
what's puny '' ? ? END
`` puny goes with pale and peaked . END
do you have anything to read while you're shut up ? ? END
there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness , and a book called ' tom swift and his speedy canoe ' ; ; END
but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister . END
also the canoe '' . END
there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot . END
the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an UNK fast ball that took a UNK . END
for a few innings the anniston team couldn't figure him out . END
then , in the fifth , UNK kid catcher caught onto a curve and UNK the ball into left center field . END
eddie lee , UNK UNK playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him . END
phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the UNK . END
eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil . END
third base '' ! ! END
phil spun around and made an accurate throw into mike UNK hands on third base . END
mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag . END
but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late . END
he came into the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in his face . END
`` you bastard '' ! ! END
the anniston catcher screamed . END
he jumped to his feet and started to throw UNK . END
mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher . END
this brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the UNK . END
the fighters were separated in a few minutes . END
the game was resumed . END
but mike deegan was boiling mad now . END
when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout . END
phil rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink . END
mike deegan was standing beside it , facing the field . END
he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began . END
`` keep your eyes open , UNK '' ! ! END
mike yelled to the catcher . END
`` you're in for trouble '' . END
the anniston catcher did not reply with words . END
he simply turned to mike and smiled . END
this so UNK deegan that he spun around and said : `` i'll get that little bastard . END
so help me god , i'll get him '' . END
phil rossoff said : `` why don't you leave him alone '' ? ? END
`` mind your own goddamn business '' , mike deegan said . END
he stepped into the dugout , wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble . END
maybe the answer was in his eyes . END
when deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips . END
in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left UNK head . END
by the time the UNK got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home . END
the left UNK threw and it was a good one . END
but mike had no chance of being tagged . END
the anniston catcher was UNK home plate . END
all deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he UNK into the catcher . END
both fell heavily to the ground . END
only mike got to his feet . END
he went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back . END
the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field . END
they poured water over their UNK face . END
he did not move . END
then the manager called for a doctor . END
the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer . END
then , quickly , and a little UNK , the doctor ordered a couple of UNK to carry the catcher into the dressing room . END
mike deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . END
when the UNK started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` that ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . END
phil rossoff , seated next to deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench . END
the anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout . END
he was followed by four of his men . END
it began to look as if something was going to happen . END
mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . END
eddie lee moved over to mike UNK side . END
no one said a word . END
the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike . END
his face was flushed . END
`` deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering . END
`` that was a UNK thing to do '' . END
`` for god's sake '' , mike said , waving the manager away . END
`` stop it , will you ? ? END
tell your guys not to block the plate '' . END
`` you didn't have to UNK him '' . END
`` that's what you say '' . END
the anniston manager looked at eddie lee . END
it was a cold and calculated look . END
he turned and went back across the field to his dugout . END
he called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right UNK moved out to the mound for anniston . END
the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat . END
everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting . END
the first ball the UNK pitcher threw came in for mike's head . END
deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him . END
he arose slowly and brushed himself off . END
he got back into the UNK box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again . END
`` hit the bum '' ! ! END
somebody yelled from the anniston bench . END
in the riverside dugout frankie ricco , shortstop , whispered into UNK ear : `` there's gonna be a fight '' . END
`` look at those bastards '' ! ! END
charlie UNK , a pitcher , said . END
`` they're looking for trouble '' . END
mike was slow getting into the box this time . END
when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in . END
`` listen '' ! ! END
he shouted to the pitcher . END
`` one more and i'm coming out there '' ! ! END
`` i'll be waiting '' ! ! END
the pitcher yelled back . END
mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat . END
he stood UNK in the box , but not very close to the plate now . END
the pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for mike's head . END
deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound . END
the pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards mike deegan . END
they were both walking towards each other , UNK . END
riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field . END
in the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , UNK , cops , kids and a dog . END
there was much shouting and screaming . END
fights sprang up and were quickly UNK . END
mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together . END
phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started . END
after the game , phil was taking off his UNK in the dressing room when mike deegan came in . END
`` it's a UNK thing '' , mike said , looking at phil , `` when a UNK own UNK won't come out and help him in a fight '' . END
phil sighed and pulled the wet UNK over his head . END
frankie ricco sat down on the bench near phil . END
the other players were UNK quietly . END
eddie lee had not come in yet . END
mike went over to phil and stood over him . END
`` why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? ? END
`` i didn't think it was necessary '' . END
now that's just fine ! ! END
you didn't think it was necessary '' . END
mike placed both his hands on his hips . END
he pushed his jaw forward . END
`` listen , wise guy , if you think i'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' . END
mike had a good two inches over phil and phil had to look up into mike's face . END
`` i didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , phil said slowly . END
`` nobody else did , either '' . END
`` you trying to say i started the fight '' ? ? END
`` i'm not trying to say anything '' . END
phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard mike deegan say : `` you're yellow , rossoff '' ! ! END
and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around . END
but before anything could happen frankie ricco was between them and eddie lee had come into the dressing room . END
`` phil , come into my office '' , eddie said . END
phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door . END
he sat down before UNK desk . END
`` i'm doing you a favor '' , eddie said quickly . END
`` you get your unconditional release as of today '' . END
UNK eyes widened just a trifle . END
`` the best thing for you to do '' , eddie said , `` is go home . END
you don't belong in professional baseball '' . END
phil had to clear his throat . END
`` is this because of what happened out there '' ? ? END
`` no '' , eddie said . END
`` but it does confirm what i've suspected all along '' . END
this is the second time . END
`` sit down , sit down '' , eddie said . END
`` i'm not saying you're yellow . END
i am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' . END
eddie lee leaned forward over the desk . END
`` now listen to me , phil . END
i'm not steering you wrong . END
you haven't got the heart for baseball '' . END
phil shook his head and eddie frowned . END
suddenly his voice grew hard . END
`` what the hell do you think baseball is ? ? END
you're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? ? END
phil started to say something but eddie cut him short . END
`` now don't tell me what a good ball player you are . END
i know you've got talent . END
but what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with . END
the heart , phil . END
you just haven't got the heart for UNK , and that's it '' . END
dazed , phil said : `` i don't get it . END
eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly . END
`` what difference does your batting average make ? ? END
or your UNK average . END
or even the way you run bases . END
i tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it . END
that's what i mean by no heart for the game . END
deegan had no business UNK into that kid out there . END
he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on . END
what the hell do you think baseball is ? ? END
it's a way of life , UNK ! ! END
and you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! ! END
it's only his opinion . END
there were other clubs in this league . END
he stood up slowly . END
he was a little pale and shaky . END
his lips felt glued together . END
`` i think you're wrong , eddie '' , he said finally . END
you'll get your pay in the morning '' . END
phil turned and left the room , hearing eddie say : `` someday you'll see i was right '' . END
phil shut the door behind him . END
outside in the dressing room , frankie ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes . END
`` what happened '' ? ? END
phil said : `` i got my release '' . END
`` you crazy '' ? ? END
`` what for '' ? ? END
frankie shook his head . END
`` i don't get it '' . END
`` i don't know '' , phil said . END
they were silent for a few moments . END
then frankie said : `` what are you gonna do '' ? ? END
phil started to take his clothes off and frankie sat down on the bench again . END
phil took off one shoe and stared at it . END
`` don't take it like this '' , frankie said . END
`` hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later . END
the leagues are full of guys like that '' . END
phil was very quiet . END
`` what are you gonna do , phil '' ? ? END
phil did not answer . END
`` why not try another club '' ? ? END
what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that ? ? END
`` UNK in tomorrow '' , frankie said . END
`` talk to whitey jackson '' . END
he just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that . END
`` will you do it , phil '' ? ? END
`` do what '' ? ? END
`` ask whitey for a job '' . END
`` sure '' , he said . END
`` UNK come in tomorrow '' ? ? END
`` i'll speak to whitey '' . END
`` UNK boy '' . END
`` i'll talk to him , all right '' . END
`` don't worry '' , frankie said . END
`` you'll get a job there . END
he needs UNK bad '' . END
`` i'm not worried about it '' , phil said . END
`` that's the way to talk . END
what else did eddie have to say '' ? ? END
`` nothing '' , phil said . END
richard's next interest seemed the product of his UNK . END
his broad reading took him into certain UNK of religion and the subject of religion began to UNK him . END
when he was twelve he took to reading st. augustine and UNK , then UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK by endless UNK and numerous UNK papers . END
for his birthday , because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the UNK and a little image of the indian god , acala . END
and one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead , which she suspected richard would enjoy . END
he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read . END
at dinner one night , when he was fourteen , richard announced , `` there is only one god '' . END
`` did you think there were two '' ? ? END
`` you don't understand '' , richard said UNK . END
through quiet laughter his mother said , `` don't speak to your father like that , richard '' . END
richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again . END
his interest in the formal study of religion UNK when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs . END
although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` the future lies in asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in asian studies . END
richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired , in his UNK , a thorough if UNK knowledge of asian lore , literature , life , politics and history . END
he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country . END
the week at home was not comfortable . END
his mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be UNK . END
she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . END
`` do you still have the book of the dead '' ? ? END
she asked him and , laughing , she added , `` i was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but i knew you'd like it '' . END
`` yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` i still have it '' . END
he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . END
as for the book of the dead , it along with his other books on religion had been UNK in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york . END
he had UNK each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames . END
then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried . END
richard left america with his clothes , his biwa and his image of acala and , on the freighter which took him to japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he UNK resemble an ancient japanese tune he had once heard . END
during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure . END
he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a UNK north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water . END
it was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . END
it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . END
in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend . END
an american student named charlotte adams had refused to take notice of his evident UNK to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . END
he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo . END
in charlotte , richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he UNK . END
in time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity . END
she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small UNK parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations . END
at one such gathering charlotte announced , `` i was at ryusenji today . END
have you ever been to ryusenji '' ? ? END
`` well , it's at UNK and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool . END
i was thoroughly startled '' . END
richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but UNK manner during the gatherings was more UNK and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the UNK words which had preceded it . END
three of the four persons present , all foreign students in tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system , an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier . END
UNK , UNK and tea were in because they could be taken noisily . END
UNK was out because it was pretentious . END
UNK was in , samuel burns had suggested , because it was too far out to stay out , even if it was a little pretentious . END
richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears . END
`` he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said charlotte . END
`` did you watch him '' ? ? END
asked a UNK girl named UNK UNK . END
`` i shouldn't have been able to do that '' . END
`` well i was able to do it '' , charlotte said with no sign of irritation . END
`` for a minute , anyhow . END
i'm surprised no one has been there . END
i've been there a number of times . END
sam , i thought you knew everything about tokyo . END
you've never been to ryusenji '' ? ? END
`` i've heard about it '' , samuel burns said . END
`` there's a little place there called lovers mound dedicated to UNK and UNK '' . END
`` yes , a little UNK place '' , charlotte said , and concluded , `` anyhow , it's all very nice . END
and the man who brought sweet potatoes into UNK is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo . END
oh , that's what i meant to tell you . END
this is the interesting part , richard '' , she had a UNK habit of trying to pull him into the talking . END
`` there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- END
`` my god , it was cold today '' , said samuel burns . END
`` twenty-two or twenty-three '' . END
`` and the water would be still colder '' , UNK seemed to shiver at the thought of it . END
`` and your golden god '' , said samuel burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath . END
it would kill one of us '' . END
`` but the point is '' , charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji , all in worship of fudo , the god of fire '' . END
richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the UNK moment to reflect sharp light . END
it was true ; ; END
fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the japanese version of acala . END
the conversation went on but richard stopped listening . END
he found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . END
he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . END
perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the UNK at ryusenji , he was unable to put it together . END
that night , after leaving UNK apartment , richard walked about for a time before returning to his room . END
when he at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala , thinking first of UNK tale of the man at ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters . END
and the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to UNK and walked to ryusenji . END
he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned . END
he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large UNK high at the back of the pool . END
on the hillside above was UNK what might have been an incarnation of fudo , or perhaps a demon . END
the strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder . END
the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be UNK to the UNK green water or the little UNK or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach . END
he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him . END
into a little well before the temple he dropped a UNK coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ; END
but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest . END
instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head . END
the black fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard's eyes were caught by the UNK in fascination , and then richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of UNK face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it . END
then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently . END
suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried back down both UNK and away from the temple , never looking back . END
he walked all the miles back to his room . END
he seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot . END
he stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji . END
but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day . END
the cold UNK , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life . END
all of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at UNK . END
i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the UNK field far across the hill from the farm buildings . END
it had grown hot early that day , and i hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water . END
the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old UNK UNK or a stick along , to play with . END
he pretended that the UNK was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . END
i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time . END
i had turned at the corner of the field and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when i looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . END
it lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch . END
the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly . END
the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further . END
i had never liked snakes much , i still had that kind of quick panic that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . END
he was UNK and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . END
go out of the furrow , snake , i said , but it did not move at all . END
i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without UNK or concern . END
i let the engine idle then , and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it . END
my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed UNK a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly . END
i followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening UNK . END
the colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm . END
the eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . END
his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . END
you beauty , i said , i couldn't kill you . END
you are much too beautiful . END
i had killed snakes before , when i was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and i knew it was UNK that an animal such as that should die . END
i picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and i could feel the coolness of that radiant , UNK body , like splendid ice , and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little UNK in the UNK of him , like UNK swallowed whole might make . END
the body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . END
i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , UNK earth , from between my pale hands . END
the snake worked away very slowly and UNK and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods . END
the sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target . END
i felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake . END
it shone in its bright diamond color against the UNK UNK and the UNK black clods of soil and against the UNK of myself . END
the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and UNK field . END
i got on the tractor again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks . END
i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house . END
the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the UNK because they were not scouring properly , and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake . END
i saw it all at a glance . END
the boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with UNK and a kind of UNK impatience . END
even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy . END
i could see the UNK shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick . END
stop it , i shouted , but the UNK and mighty tractor roared on , above anything i could say . END
i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy , and i knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , UNK dance . END
it was no use . END
i felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before , and i wanted to run down there and halt , if i could , that UNK pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his UNK , and save a UNK , a UNK , of that which i remembered , but i knew it was already too late . END
i drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; END
i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . END
my head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and i hated the job suddenly , and i thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish . END
i felt the anger mount within me . END
the boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown UNK in the heat of the morning . END
i knew the boy well . END
he was eleven and we had done many things together . END
he was a beautiful boy , really , with UNK blonde hair and a smooth and still UNK face , and his UNK were long and dark and UNK , and his eyes were blue . END
he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . END
he was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and UNK , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well . END
i saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where i had been not long before . END
i stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me . END
`` can i ride around with you '' ? ? END
he asked , as he often did , and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me . END
i looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; END
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his . END
`` no , you cannot '' , i said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me . END
i pointed to the UNK , upright stake . END
`` did you do that '' ? ? END
`` yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement . END
`` i killed a snake ; ; END
it was a big one '' . END
he tried to take my hand to show me . END
`` why did you kill it '' ? ? END
`` snakes are ugly and bad '' . END
`` this snake was very beautiful . END
didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? ? END
`` snakes are ugly '' , he said again . END
`` you saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ? END
have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ? END
`` snakes are ugly and bad , and it might have UNK somebody , and they would have died '' . END
`` you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area . END
this snake could not harm anything '' . END
`` they eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said . END
`` they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes '' . END
`` you are talking UNK '' , i said . END
`` you killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' . END
`` they're ugly and i hate them '' , the boy insisted . END
`` nobody likes snakes '' . END
`` it was beautiful '' , i said , half to myself . END
the boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done . END
the fire of the colors was gone ; ; END
there was a UNK ugliness now ; ; END
the colors of its back were dull and UNK , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes . END
the UNK head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a UNK , and the forked tongue UNK out of the twisted , torn mouth . END
the snake was hideous , and i remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life . END
i UNK the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the UNK part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals . END
i touched it and the coolness , the UNK , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny UNK of the dead muscles , and i hoped that it was truly dead , so that i would not have to kill it . END
and then it moved a little more , and i knew the snake was dying , and i would have to kill it there . END
the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing UNK in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . END
i'm sorry , i thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . END
i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the UNK from the UNK and i struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live . END
the boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . END
`` it's a big snake , isn't it '' ? ? END
`` i'm going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed '' . END
`` don't you see what you have done '' ? ? END
`` don't you see the difference now '' ? ? END
`` it's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said . END
he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes . END
i could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the UNK brutality . END
`` don't '' , i said . END
i could have slapped the boy . END
he looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side . END
i thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes . END
i wanted to UNK his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal UNK from his mouth , and i decided then , very suddenly , what i would do . END
cady didn't come UNK easily , but this had not been a day of glad UNK . END
tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from hanford college , his own alma UNK , a real UNK . END
hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago . END
yes , the boy's UNK were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards . END
but due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ? END
cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort . END
this was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , david , in hanford . END
his son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life . END
his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief . END
he wondered if he had played it wrong . END
maybe he should have kept in touch . END
gone back for UNK . END
but he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at hanford , class of 1935 . END
besides , cady partlow knew he wasn't the UNK . END
it wouldn't help anyway . END
look at pete UNK , who hadn't missed a hanford ball game in fifteen years . END
UNK son was rejected . END
hanford college , little ivy league , had no room for football players with low grades . END
cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride . END
good solid b average with a sprinkling of a's in math and science . END
imagine his son being that good in science ! ! END
mr. partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford . END
but then , he hadn't studied very hard . END
getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and UNK . END
he put down his pipe and started to type . END
`` in response to your letter , i can in good conscience recommend my son , david , in the field of leadership '' . END
he stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for hanford college . END
he didn't have to be told his son looked like him . END
david had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness . END
he turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence . END
`` his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming . END
his chief motivation for UNK at hanford is the desire to '' -- END
mr. partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , UNK the letter . END
he paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build . END
how do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do ? ? END
that you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` of course david has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ? END
how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ? END
just give him time , give him a chance . END
cady snapped the venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head . END
what a production to make of a letter UNK your own son ! ! END
his eyebrow went up in amusement at his UNK panic . END
he told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics . END
he told hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities . END
he belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club . END
he finished with a flurry of good wishes to hanford college and signed the letter . END
there , that did it . END
then he met the grave eyes of his wife , anne , from the photograph next to UNK . END
he shoved the UNK letter into his coat pocket . END
better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything . END
after all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of partlow products . END
anne had a way with words . END
half of it was natural , half was smith college . END
yet the whole of anne was something she had never learned in any college . END
a woman had it or she didn't . END
she said what she meant and let it be . END
she never got on his back . END
he could take the advice or leave it . END
he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator . END
`` you look like you just heard a real UNK , mr. partlow '' . END
cady looked at tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years . END
`` i was just thinking how things have changed . END
when i went to college they begged you to come . END
be our guest ! ! END
it's our pleasure ! ! END
now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and UNK with knowledge '' ! ! END
tom slid open the door to the lobby . END
`` that's a fact , mr. partlow . END
my john applied to six colleges before he got in '' . END
`` going to state '' ? ? END
he's president of the rocket club here , you know . END
always UNK around with science stuff . END
real bright along those lines , you might say . END
he got a science scholarship to yale '' . END
`` oh '' , said mr. partlow , `` that's fine , tom . END
as he drove home through the UNK traffic , cady felt the UNK growing . END
he hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for david . END
they had all turned down his son . END
he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him . END
but tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no UNK from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . END
nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did . END
he liked looking at anne . END
he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of UNK across her nose . END
from those UNK eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as david did . END
she always could sense the UNK end of a UNK day . END
`` board meeting tonight , cady '' ? ? END
`` no , i begged off . END
work to do '' . END
`` can i have the car , dad '' ? ? END
`` why not let him take it , cady ? ? END
i know it is UNK , but it's only eight days before UNK . END
let's forget the rules '' . END
cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered . END
carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` mr. chairman '' ! ! END
cady UNK head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse . END
`` i'm sorry , dave . END
of course you can have it '' . END
dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest . END
`` hear anything from hanford yet , dad '' ? ? END
cady begged the question . END
`` don't worry about it , dave . END
your acceptance will come through '' . END
dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys . END
`` don't be too sure , dad . END
charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a UNK student '' . END
anne said it wasn't surprising because charles was UNK , a lone wolf , and completely UNK . END
`` i can hardly say the same about you , dave '' ! ! END
dave kissed her lightly . END
`` girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! ! END
get my old man to bed early . END
he looks a little bit UNK '' . END
anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the UNK . END
`` let's go into the library . END
you do seem somewhat tattered '' . END
cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable UNK room . END
`` i didn't know i looked so UNK '' ! ! END
`` wrong word , darling . END
your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it . END
need any help '' ? ? END
`` in a way , yes . END
hanford college hasn't decided on UNK application yet . END
they want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership . END
here's what i wrote '' . END
cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was UNK . END
already he could feel anne's questioning eyes . END
`` i know you wrote this in a hurry , but , cady , dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days . END
that was when half the school was down with flu '' . END
`` but he was president '' . END
`` and he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club . END
he just took over the week bill UNK was in the state basketball UNK '' . END
cady stuck his jaw out . END
`` the fact remains he was treasurer '' . END
`` and the swimming team . END
no , cady , he made second team . END
just missed the first '' . END
`` a team is a team '' , insisted cady . END
`` anything else '' ? ? END
`` yes '' , she said quietly . END
`` i don't think you've been quite honest , cady . END
it isn't like you . END
he was mad about stars at the age of nine . END
geology , you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the UNK six years ago ! ! END
those aren't his interests now '' . END
`` what do you suggest '' ? ? END
`` just say he likes swimming , tennis , UNK and music '' . END
he hasn't been to a symphony concert all season '' . END
`` but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts '' ! ! END
`` you mean that UNK combo ? ? END
even in that he never UNK like jack on guitar or rich on sax . END
he's -- he's just there , that's all '' . END
`` yes , he's just there . END
he keeps the beat going . END
he likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo . END
he doesn't like to rise and shine . END
don't worry , cady , he'll be back in the beethoven fold by next year '' . END
cady appeared slightly UNK . END
but i refuse to be UNK honest and mention chief crazy horse and his five colts '' . END
anne laughed and cady felt the tension UNK its grip on the back of his neck . END
`` maybe i am UNK it a bit , anne '' , he said . END
`` but you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college . END
he has to have leadership as well as grades '' . END
anne folded the UNK document . END
`` did you know he is advertising his UNK equipment for sale this weekend ? ? END
he hasn't used it now for several years . END
can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ? END
cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel . END
`` and what would you say he wants to do ? ? END
just what '' ? ? END
`` it's dave who is applying to hanford college . END
why don't you ask him '' ? ? END
for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so he could yell back . END
`` i have talked to him , but you know i've never tried to push him into any profession . END
i won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' . END
anne picked up the towel she was UNK for the hospital guild . END
`` just because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off . END
but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold . END
you want him to be a leader of men , like you '' . END
cady put the UNK chip back on his shoulder . END
`` dave has qualities of leadership . END
he just hasn't developed them yet . END
give him time '' . END
he never will , cady . END
not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people . END
all your wishful thinking won't change that . END
remember what you used to say in the army ? ? END
you can't run a war with UNK generals and one private '' ! ! END
cady walked the block to the UNK , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne . END
martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all . END
and once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . END
the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . END
lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . END
when he rose in the morning , the image was still there . END
he had always been a UNK and UNK man . END
in his bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order . END
no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps . END
but it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug . END
there was an UNK UNK in his grinning refusal to pick them up . END
half UNK he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things . END
he remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party . END
the smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals . END
her hair was the color of those UNK which in seed UNK are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of UNK or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad UNK of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of UNK which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness . END
so he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair . END
or against her back , pressed on the column of UNK , which held her so magnificently straight and UNK , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip . END
but , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped . END
yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then . END
more he could take at leisure . END
all martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ? END
he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly . END
there was too little occasion UNK for resistance , the brave strong UNK of emotional clash and meeting . END
they had left themselves too much to discover . END
but , at the start , his new life felt UNK . END
it was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ? END
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor . END
`` now , i'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! ! END
martin gave her a UNK pat . END
`` i think you'll get tired of them there '' . END
in the morning the shorts were where he had left them . END
he smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till dolores did . END
it was almost too easy . END
for he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests . END
the shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening . END
the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a UNK UNK , but in the middle of the carpet lay the UNK shorts . END
they gave the room a strange note of UNK , like a mole on a beautiful face . END
he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous . END
quietly he determined to foil her . END
i can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; END
my nerves are as strong . END
she'll rush to the bedroom when the UNK rings . END
martin was standing a few feet from the front door . END
he swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away . END
dolores stood motionless in the doorway . END
he could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to UNK the shorts . END
martin turned his back . END
he strode to answer the bell . END
bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet . END
with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , dolores led UNK to the bedroom . END
martin strained his ears . END
at first he could not be sure . END
then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there . END
a UNK of giggles slid over their voices . END
all evening UNK favored him with odd , coy looks . END
clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' . END
for some reason , this UNK in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic . END
at last there was a void no one could fill . END
the UNK went home early . END
martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with dolores that night . END
as violently as possible . END
but he was so taken UNK , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in . END
on the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he UNK , while she stayed calm and adamant . END
and if he surrendered after UNK at her . END
suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ? END
he considered the sober possibility . END
in his head was the echo of those UNK with UNK . END
there was something about private feminine UNK which always made him feel UNK and unclean . END
he remembered his mother UNK with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating UNK which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening . END
he could even recall the last time he sat there . END
she was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` afterwards martin said he was sorry . END
he apologized so sweetly , i couldn't keep being annoyed with him '' . END
it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ; END
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it . END
but his mother told the story over and over , till her `` martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , UNK ears . END
the battle had to be fought . END
let the best sex win . END
but his resolution hardly seemed to help . END
if the situation had been bad , it now got worse . END
about this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough . END
angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away . END
here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by . END
these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment . END
of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts . END
it was curious how the different visitors took this . END
some tried to ignore the blot on the UNK countenance . END
quite a few laughed . END
to them all dolores told a UNK and witty tale . END
`` it's a little contest martin and i have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a UNK and deceptive course . END
while he waited in the living room . END
once martin went along . END
they entered the bedroom , and dolores said nothing . END
then one of the guests showed his UNK . END
`` you were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ? END
martin would have liked to break the man's neck . END
she let the interpretation stand . END
now martin heard himself give a UNK of mock good nature . END
with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : it's a little contest -- END
never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment . END
they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations . END
but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything . END
what to talk about ? ? END
dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in UNK his possessions . END
he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and UNK , so his life might UNK as little as possible on hers . END
the shorts alone remained . END
in his moments of worst agony , martin imagined what his friends were saying . END
the sound of their amazement . END
bizarre : he could hear the word . END
the most bizarre situation . END
we were up to visit them and END
he had thought her exactly what he wanted . END
six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously . END
pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now . END
everyone would know why ; ; END
he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure . END
day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself . END
his mind UNK frantically , seeking an exit . END
alternately he had periods of hostile UNK in which he determined UNK , UNK , to live out his life in this fashion . END
nothing would change , nothing would ever change . END
when the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before . END
in a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan . END
beside his shorts , he would place something of hers . END
UNK he would have won an UNK moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her UNK , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . END
he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own UNK which he had laid on the floor . END
furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a UNK , or maybe a UNK , next to his shorts . END
sooner or later , dolores would crack . END
on the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment . END
martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story . END
the tale , he thought , would become less gay . END
she had used his UNK shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male UNK , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an UNK body . END
to have her UNK linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd . END
something in the back of his mind was aware that the UNK of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and UNK were involved , because it was truly his . END
the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism . END
the next morning , while dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of UNK lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts . END
he sat down on the bed . END
in a surprisingly short time , dolores appeared . END
to his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments . END
slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second . END
ah , he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too . END
he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him . END
extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room . END
she did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes UNK . END
they UNK together , but martin did not refer to his triumph , and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , UNK up and down from the table so that talk was impossible . END
well , martin thought , that'll save . END
he left for work in high spirits . END
as he relaxed that day , martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks . END
he found that he no longer hated dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a UNK of an affectionate feeling . END
`` good old a-z '' , cap said . END
`` you know , i've got one of your cars at home . END
as a prominent UNK , you ought to be interested in his UNK support group . END
isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ? END
once it was , william thought . END
but not any more . END
a rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot cap . END
how did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ? END
simply enough , through the UNK agency of his brother-in-law . END
general UNK draft and doc UNK and cap were responsible for his first eminence , but fearless freddy bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time . END
freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and UNK financing by UNK , and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one . END
mr. willis bought zenith plastic products , a UNK corporation of sorts which had undergone many UNK and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed freddy in an executive position . END
shortly after , freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas . END
willis listened patiently , and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; END
he generally heard freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own UNK concerns . END
probably mr. willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren . END
UNK began to aid freddy with her father , UNK , no doubt , by UNK open contempt for freddy and william's irritating UNK . END
another factor must have been the eventual disposal of UNK fortune ; ; END
she unquestionably assumed that the more he was UNK with freddy , the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death . END
whatever the reasons , willis and bryan started expanding zenith . END
they acquired another electronics factory , a specialized UNK company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research UNK . END
since they were hunting for national defense contracts , adam UNK , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections . END
feeling his power , freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer . END
heavy industry , UNK toward UNK government UNK , attracted him . END
the allstates auto company , a UNK firm which manufactured UNK vehicles and other UNK equipment , had recently constructed an UNK , modern plant in a burst of UNK optimism . END
cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for UNK , and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . END
with UNK blessing , he was convinced that UNK wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane UNK , tanks , missiles or UNK of some kind . END
at that point william came into the picture . END
although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of zenith . END
freed of routine by having his own firm and a UNK partner , his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; END
and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities . END
mr. willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and william set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to wisconsin and washington . END
in the end , he said : `` i'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir . END
i know a guy named jack hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with UNK , and i took him with me to allstates . END
it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind . END
the conversion will cost a fortune . END
besides that , i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force . END
i think adam UNK is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side . END
missiles have thrown everything up for UNK , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here . END
the future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have UNK the UNK trade -- one jet can take the place of three UNK planes . END
this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough . END
here are a few facts and figures i've assembled . END
can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust UNK '' ? ? END
willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged . END
`` well '' , he said , `` there is freddy , you know . END
freddy is deeply committed to our plans already . END
he assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and ham richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem . END
i don't like to exhibit the deadly UNK effect of an elderly man's caution '' . END
`` yes , i appreciate that . END
i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm lukewarm ; ; END
i've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me . END
if we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the UNK on opposite sides , brandishing their UNK '' . END
`` which is a frightful prospect , bill '' . END
`` one shouldn't mix commercial affairs with UNK , but in this case i have no choice . END
let me think about it . END
i'm most grateful to you , so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy '' . END
not to william's surprise , freddy , adam and hamilton richert prevailed ; ; END
allied to them was UNK , devoting much time to UNK her father , and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further . END
zenith absorbed allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and freddy became president of the UNK combination . END
through jack hamrick , william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for UNK and clay . END
he forgot about a-z till , unhappily , he and hamrick were proved correct . END
freddy's backing dropped away from him and mr. willis was forced to make up the deficit . END
adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end . END
the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant . END
stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value . END
confronted by a grim future , freddy lost his nerve and UNK for a drastic liquidation . END
once more willis summoned william . END
`` you were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and i'm in something of a bind . END
freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me . END
in addition to other defects , i'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment . END
will you see if you can help me '' ? ? END
william spent a long week end UNK with hamrick . END
his recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of UNK useless wisconsin UNK , exposure to exciting conceptions of UNK that nobody would buy , and the UNK recent failure of a respected but UNK UNK manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to UNK it . END
initially , UNK reaction to a-z going into the passenger car market was discouraging . END
he thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of UNK was simply too difficult . END
then he caught fire . END
if a-z could buy ticonderoga UNK and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if william could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money UNK was not UNK . END
they took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . END
taking hamrick with him , william went to mr. willis . END
he was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report . END
`` your alternative is UNK '' , he said , `` and , i'm frank in saying , a bit mad . END
i wish i was younger and less timid . END
well , i can't resolve this myself . END
i'll have to call in the brain trust . END
are you willing to run the UNK ? ? END
i can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' . END
`` we'll be in there swinging '' , william said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself . END
you have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage . END
if they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' . END
`` i should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you . END
you mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away . END
you're -- you're arthur willis . END
forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' . END
`` i rather like the music '' , willis replied quietly . END
`` thank you '' . END
at the meeting , attended by freddy , richert , UNK and the a-z executive staff , with mr. willis presiding , william and hamrick did indeed run the UNK . END
from shock and UNK , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and UNK . END
`` oh , my god '' , ham richert said , `` a little child shall lead them . END
move over , general motors '' . END
`` it's absurd , bill '' , freddy said , from a pale face . END
`` you're leading dad down the garden path '' . END
`` your garden , god damn it '' ! ! END
`` i don't enjoy family quarrels '' , adam said . END
`` nor crazy relatives . END
we're here to UNK business . END
can't we put an end to this , arthur '' ? ? END
`` hear me out , please '' , william begged . END
`` i'm an advertising hustler , i admit , but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere . END
sure , ticonderoga went broke in the UNK market bucking the big three . END
their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were old-fashioned . END
they tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit . END
we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery . END
we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age . END
look what those little european jobs are doing . END
we'll UNK the consumer with a product , not UNK him with UNK excess length and weight . END
let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a UNK , at reasonable rates . END
ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made . END
we've got rid of the steam UNK and UNK houses , and the UNK , UNK automobile is next . END
why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an UNK '' ? ? END
he swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on . END
financing emerged as the main obstacle . END
mr. willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum . END
`` nobody will UNK it , i'm telling you '' , freddy said . END
`` i know what i'm talking about in that department '' . END
`` there's plenty of risk money '' , ham richert added , `` but not for anything this UNK '' . END
`` all right '' , william said . END
`` we'll try to swing the deal on that basis . END
if we can't raise the capital , we're through . END
nothing has been lost . END
you're up against it anyhow . END
why won't you give me a chance '' ? ? END
heads instinctively turned in UNK direction . END
he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together . END
`` i feel i must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the UNK later , if any , should fall on me -- i don't relish UNK spread broadcast outside my family . END
i'm not giving you a chance , bill , but UNK myself of your generous offer of assistance . END
good luck to you '' . END
`` all the UNK have got to have their day '' , adam said , and glared at william and freddy in turn . END
sweat started out on william's forehead , whether from relief or UNK he could not tell . END
across the table , hamrick UNK him UNK with an UNK thumb and forefinger . END
nobody else showed pleasure . END
UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK with UNK glasses and an ivy league suit , jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club . END
`` hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned . END
`` i suppose i can never expect to call you ' general ' after that washington episode '' . END
`` i'm afraid not '' . END
it was among these that UNK identified a photograph of barco ! ! END
for it seems that barco , UNK himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ? END
) , had listed himself for UNK beard roles at the UNK of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` with your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! ! END
mills secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of UNK barco . END
on their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main UNK to question the attendants . END
finally , at ye UNK UNK filling station on avocado avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to san diego . END
they headed in that direction and , at san juan UNK UNK came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drive-in , eating a hot UNK . END
at the moment , barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search . END
the robe , however , was missing , for by that time barco had disposed of it at a UNK in UNK . END
the detectives placed barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to hollywood for questioning . END
thus it was that barco , UNK for mere UNK , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered . END
during the return trip , barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` they're under sand dunes they're better off , i tell you i saved their souls '' . END
the detective , commenting on barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally UNK -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut '' ! ! END
however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . END
the attempt had failed because , when UNK to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had UNK at the sight of blood . END
the jail authorities -- UNK no particular significance to the episode -- offered barco whisky to revive him ; ; END
but the old fellow , a UNK UNK , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter . END
then it was that district attorney welch entered the case . END
a man of UNK ambition , with one eye on the UNK of los angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . END
it was reported to welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . END
welch wanted to know why . END
now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at . END
the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test . END
so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly : END
`` barco , we've got the goods on you ! ! END
it'll be a lot better if you come clean '' . END
at first barco was evasive and UNK . END
but with welch's relentless pursuit of the subject , barco finally `` broke '' and started UNK to one murder after another . END
by the time barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true . END
but if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial . END
welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell . END
but to welch's chagrin , the police captain UNK welch's UNK in barco's confession . END
barco was clearly a `` nut '' . END
it required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder . END
`` that worm a murderer ? ? END
then , for the first time since his arrest , a UNK of spirit lit barco's eyes . END
his manhood had been attacked . END
he stiffened and rose to his feet . END
he'd show them ! ! END
`` is that so '' ? ? END
`` well , for ten years i've been UNK women . END
i can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! ! END
the next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` welch's wild goose chase '' . END
for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in hollywood . END
the searching party consisted of the police captain , welch , barco , policemen with UNK , newspaper reporters , and UNK . END
barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a UNK which remained his principal attitude from that time on . END
he directed the UNK of UNK to the sand dunes near santa UNK . END
stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two UNK sand hills , and indicated a location . END
orders were given to dig . END
the police captain UNK . END
the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barco's pride was aroused . END
with greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left . END
with UNK and UNK , the policemen again started digging . END
welch was on edge . END
the captain was UNK that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the UNK struck an object . END
`` there's something here '' ! ! END
joking stopped and everyone gathered around . END
the UNK , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package UNK wrapped in one of the UNK hollywood sport UNK . END
although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough . END
welch was wild with delight . END
his UNK grew as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another . END
now did welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him . END
it went to his head , and his ambition increased . END
it was apparent that welch was in UNK with marshall and would use his power as UNK to drag every possible sensation into the case . END
every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for UNK pen would thus mean more publicity for welch . END
i knew that both these UNK were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand . END
once there , the UNK with UNK UNK would provide marshall with headlines : `` viola's multiple UNK '' `` viola lake an UNK '' `` downfall of another film idol '' ! ! END
it would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! ! END
i studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted . END
it wasn't long before i sensed that there was something deeper than UNK ambition back of his desire for viola's destruction . END
he was bitter and UNK toward her , personally UNK . END
a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some UNK UNK . END
i did not rest until i had UNK the mystery down . END
well , here it is . END
one day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . END
viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone . END
she arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; END
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor . END
naturally , viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host . END
and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; ; END
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as fate would have it , belonged to district attorney welch . END
as viola sat there , a UNK impulse UNK her to remove the shoes and socks from the UNK feet and , as a UNK , insert rosebuds between the toes . END
a little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture forum on `` the civic spirit of the UNK '' , in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to UNK . END
he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and UNK selected his hat from the many on the bed . END
then , noting neither the absence of his UNK nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the UNK . END
the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined . END
the incident , aside from reflecting on welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life . END
he never rested until he discovered who the UNK was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance came his way . END
and here it was ! ! END
by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion . END
during these first days of the trial i didn't have as much time to UNK with viola as i should have liked . END
in the first place , it was difficult for us to meet . END
we couldn't be seen together , for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent . END
i couldn't invite viola to our house , for mother UNK refused to receive her . END
now the UNK had not affected my own sense of social values , but mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of los UNK society to her . END
there , mother was received by the UNK of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the UNK ( of beer derivation ) , the UNK ( of UNK origin ) , and the UNK ( whose UNK founded a nationally famous trade in UNK ) . END
i hated being dragged into the UNK of these UNK . END
but mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the UNK is ever received in their exclusive UNK . END
in fact , it was not until the king of spain had visited at UNK that mary and UNK were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the UNK . END
mother even went so far as to UNK up for me UNK opportunities with pasadena UNK who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more UNK los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . END
but at long last came a time when i broke away from mother and her society `` UNK '' in order to spend a UNK evening with viola and her UNK at her home . END
however , such a UNK of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , society , and even , alas , to my own mother . END
when i arrived at viola's i was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . END
viola greeted me , in checked apron , UNK in hand , and explained it was the UNK night out and that she herself was preparing dinner . END
i sat and watched proceedings . END
there was to be roast chicken with dressing , UNK gravy , UNK , new peas with a UNK of mint , UNK onions , and UNK potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by viola herself . END
i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater . END
the most that was accomplished was adding mrs. UNK tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion . END
i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly . END
here's a household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone . END
no matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you UNK within seconds after you pick up the phone . END
UNK and UNK twined themselves around me , murmuring UNK . END
louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . END
somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` won't you hold on a second , please '' , i covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including devil's island and the UNK reaches of siberia . END
i promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . END
speaking into the phone again and recognizing the UNK , i resumed my everyday voice . END
soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like UNK holding her breath and pretending to black out , UNK dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various UNK , UNK , and giggles . END
under the circumstances , i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that hank and i be there . END
i discovered that the girls had UNK vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room . END
it seemed that i would be the UNK if i accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats . END
UNK to get something done , i started in on the dishes . END
i'm not saying it right . END
what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . END
they looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that i found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to UNK again , this time about francesca and her husband . END
how about them , i thought . END
francesca and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia . END
we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after i met fran at a UNK meeting , and had taken us in hand socially . END
they had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since catatonia was just a village ; ; END
the yellow pages of the telephone book were UNK thin ) . END
they were `` personalities '' . END
herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin UNK , and UNK , was men's fashion editor of UNK , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation . END
fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from nebraska , or was it wyoming ? ? END
she was the daughter and sole UNK of either a cattle UNK or an oil UNK and , having arrived in new york with a big bank roll , became a UNK in various fields . END
she UNK greenwich village artists for awhile , then put some money into a broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) . END
it was during her `` writing '' period that she and herb met and decided that they were in love . END
they were married at a UNK ceremony which was duly recorded in UNK and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they UNK in bermuda . END
no , not bermuda . END
bermuda was not in style that year . END
they had UNK in rome ; ; END
everyone was very high on rome that year . END
they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of UNK surrounding new york ; ; END
they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names . END
`` you are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but people who do things '' . END
i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things . END
their house was a UNK colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and UNK , and added on to . END
it had a UNK corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud . END
it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time . END
their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences . END
francesca and herbert considered themselves violently UNK and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) . END
fran UNK her independence by UNK against the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and UNK socks by wearing bermuda shorts and UNK socks in colors ; ; END
bright UNK and UNK and vivid stripes . END
sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the UNK . END
no one could dislike them , i thought . END
sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human . END
it seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement . END
practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; END
you should hear the reverence in UNK voice when she said `` UNK '' or `` UNK '' or `` madame alexander '' . END
she always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been UNK in brandy , and that UNK second cousin was an intimate of theirs . END
i wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally unreal . END
i couldn't feel at home among them . END
besides francesca , there was blanche . END
francesca was pleasant and charming , but blanche was sweet . END
yes , blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted UNK . END
i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum UNK , `` oh , my UNK has collapsed '' . END
anyone knows how a real , UNK woman would react to such a catastrophe ! ! END
if blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , UNK things . END
but dear me , no ; ; END
after five minutes with blanche , one might welcome the UNK of grazie , who was a sort of UNK UNK to UNK UNK UNK . END
francesca and grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected UNK , equal bosses , of whatever UNK or civic project was being launched . END
they were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen UNK for social leadership . END
grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , UNK UNK . END
she it was who had looked to see if i was wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive . END
grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast . END
she lived in an UNK house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; ; END
the pets were a couple of siamese cats . END
her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , UNK , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick . END
the husbands of these women and others i had met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , UNK . END
i couldn't tell one from the other . END
like herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising . END
one or two were writers of books ; ; END
all were fellows of finite charm . END
each had developed a UNK chuckle and the habit of saying `` UNK '' ! ! END
in deference to UNK . END
i never thought i'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` UNK '' ! ! END
i wouldn't have missed it for anything . END
they were `` sincere '' -- men of the UNK UNK and the urgent smile . END
these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , UNK with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting . END
could such UNK love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ? END
they were always UNK to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and i UNK the whole lot of them to the same degree that i UNK bake shops that called themselves `` sanitary bake shops '' . END
'' i thought , and wondered what kind of UNK such odd UNK would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; END
UNK who looked like UNK UNK even at UNK conferences and who never called the school principal `` mister '' . END
i sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than UNK yearly ; ; END
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` person to person '' ; ; END
people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; END
who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . END
in my estimation , they were people who read UNK du UNK , and discussed kafka ; ; END
well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` kafka '' ! ! END
UNK and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about kafka , not having read kafka . END
they were , i felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . END
becoming aware that it was nearly UNK , i brought myself back to the tasks at hand . END
i made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen . END
then , i remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week . END
`` UNK '' ! ! END
UNK had shouted each time . END
`` they're not dessert ! ! END
they're not even food . END
they're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' . END
i dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a UNK cake with chocolate UNK . END
( sometimes i think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put garlic in it , put chocolate in it . END
the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the UNK of taste UNK mama had been providing . END
then UNK closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` take my hand , louise ; ; END
i'm a stranger in paradise '' . END
needless to say , i was furious at this UNK UNK upon free enterprise . END
how dared they demand to `` UNK '' in private financial records , UNK , confidential contracts and agreements ? ? END
`` it is as though '' , i said on the historic UNK , UNK radio broadcast which i bought ( following father coughlin and UNK the eddie UNK , manhattan UNK and major UNK shows ) `` that man in the white house , like some UNK of UNK , insisted on reading my diary , UNK my UNK and UNK my UNK ! ! END
'' my impassioned plea for civil rights created a UNK of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the eddie UNK comedy hour on a permanent basis . END
but what quarter could a poor UNK woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ? END
the savage UNK UNK of red russian communism descended on the athens that was mighty UNK , UNK and UNK with their UNK battle cry of `` soak the rich ' ! ! END
after an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while i , who had always remained aloof from such UNK practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned and the little i legally inherited as UNK helpless UNK , was `` UNK '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , UNK savings . END
i was also publicly UNK , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such UNK publications as the new republic , the new yorker , time and the christian science UNK . END
it was then that i UNK myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax UNK . END
the litigation was costly and seemingly endless . END
i fought like a UNK but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court ( 1937 ) , mr. roosevelt and his `` UNK '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me . END
presidential coercion had succeeded not only in UNK the courtiers , `` UNK '' and UNK of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! ! END
i was ready , like UNK , to present my own brief . END
but the supreme court wouldn't even hear my case ! ! END
my plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' . END
again , my name was on all the front pages . END
i was , it seemed , UNK non UNK in every quarter , but not entirely without a UNK following of noted political thinkers and students of UNK . END
as charles evans hughes said , `` miss UNK limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a UNK '' . END
albert UNK was quoted as saying : `` the workings of the woman's mind UNK me '' . END
henry ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding '' . END
heywood UNK wrote : `` UNK UNK is the most original thinker since UNK '' , and even UNK had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of miss UNK , america would rapidly resemble ancient UNK and UNK '' . END
not only were the court costs UNK , but i was subjected to crippling UNK , in addition to UNK interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that UNK and i owed -- a severe financial blow . END
nor , as UNK said , had the UNK done my career `` any good '' . END
my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` UNK UNK '' , and even `` UNK '' ! ! END
i point now with pride to the fact that , long UNK the committee on un-american activities , the minute women , the economic council and other such notable `` UNK '' organizations were so much as heard of , i was hollywood's leading bulwark against communism , fighting UNK `` creeping socialism '' against such UNK odds as the UNK troops of the UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom UNK employed secretly , through the transparent UNK of regular `` relief '' checks . END
needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period . END
could it do otherwise ? ? END
even though i have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all UNK . END
such sweeping UNK are hardly UNK to `` oscar '' winning performances . END
i tried my hardest , with little help , may i say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe . END
having ( through my UNK effort and devotion ) achieved UNK , a fortune and a UNK wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , letch proceeded to neglect them all . END
never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow UNK -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because miss UNK UNK and `` UNK '' had never learned his part . END
each time letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , i was the one to be patient , helpful and UNK while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , UNK others , going into `` UNK '' and , on more occasions than i care to count , UNK off the `` set '' for the rest of the day . END
as for his finances , i was never privileged to know exactly how much money letch had `` salted away '' . END
it was i who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even UNK bills at his UNK and the los angeles athletic club . END
never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a UNK jaw . END
( but that is another story . END
) as for his private UNK , they were rapidly UNK in drinking , UNK and UNK . END
more than once i was confronted by professional gamblers , `` UNK '' , loan `` UNK '' , gangsters , `` UNK '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class i did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses , `` or else '' i shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . END
and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the UNK of accents , telephoned to announce to me that letch had UNK their unborn children ! ! END
having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly UNK when i thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' i would have proudly given my husband . END
`` ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his UNK and UNK retort whenever i suggested `` starting a family '' . END
letch had made it UNK clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . END
i now felt it wiser to keep UNK in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the society of friends all year around . END
her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying UNK UNK , i had neglected to consider a room for UNK , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . END
( i sometimes feel that god , in his infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . END
it almost always works out for the best . END
yet i UNK this man , letch UNK , why , i cannot say . END
with faint heart and a brave smile , i endured his long UNK from UNK UNK , his coldness , his indifference , his UNK and his abuse . END
the times i can recall when i was publicly UNK by him -- lovely dinner parties in our UNK suite where the UNK was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and UNK at a table where the host's chair was vacant ; ; END
a `` UNK party '' at the new pool , which i had built in the hope of keeping letch away from public beaches , when letch and a certain UNK stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; END
a lovely UNK party at UNK UNK , on which sacred occasion letch stole away with an unknown `` UNK '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best i could . END
these are but a sampling of the UNK i endured . END
as mrs. letch UNK , was it any wonder that i , once the social arbiter of UNK , was excluded from the smart UNK given by the UNK , the UNK , the gables , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK and such devout , closely knit families as the UNK and the UNK ? ? END
as UNK UNK conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable `` UNK '' gathering . END
between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it . END
our last joint venture , UNK lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the UNK of america's first saint in november , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish . END
as i was playing mother cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me . END
but in order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble , i wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing UNK who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini . END
and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ? END
did he trouble to UNK the very small part which i had `` UNK '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ? END
did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio UNK -- or even at all ? ? END
he did not ! ! END
the `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! ! END
most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` UNK '' , illegal gambling UNK , a certain `` residential club for young UNK '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club . END
whenever he UNK to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , UNK , rude and insulting . END
he made many UNK , UNK and UNK remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general . END
by the time the film was released we were three million dollars UNK , war was UNK and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini . END
thanks to letch UNK and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable . END
only george UNK seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` miss UNK has UNK the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet UNK by hollywood '' . END
but it was small UNK . END
in a rare fit of anger and spite , i `` UNK out '' my own husband to a small and most UNK studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . END
( an actor must have discipline . END
) the film was called the diet of worms , which i felt was just what letch deserved . END
it turned out to be a life of martin luther , of all things ! ! END
it was a disaster ! ! END
in clothes , letch simply did not project . END
he was laughed off the screen . END
at the same time , however , i UNK myself of the services of that great english actor and master of make-up , sir UNK pratt , to do a `` UNK '' called the mystery of the mad UNK , in which i played a young american girl who UNK a haunted castle on the english UNK which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , UNK to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac . END
it was a `` UNK '' made on a `` UNK '' and not the sort of film i like , as all i had to do was look blank and scream a great deal . END
my heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career . END
( i watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . END
letch had returned from his UNK UNK and more badly behaved than before . END
i really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person letch had once been , i took my troubles to UNK , hoping that her earthy advice would help me . END
`` if i could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his UNK energy '' , i said . END
`` what is letch interested in '' ? ? END
`` UNK , booze and UNK '' , UNK said bluntly . END
her reply UNK me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference . END
`` i can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , i said . END
up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it . END
it wasn't his fault that these things were so . END
the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately . END
as a result , life had become a kind of continuous UNK . END
once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . END
then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . END
he had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . END
then they had always been UNK around him on these walks , UNK with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy UNK . END
dogs did something to one's ego . END
they were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys . END
regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference . END
now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . END
what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons ? ? END
you certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous UNK . END
why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ? END
it worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . END
he would wake up in the middle of the night and UNK about it . END
how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a UNK brief case ? ? END
was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ? END
could it be that it UNK up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ? END
or was the answer less metaphysical ? ? END
did older people work more slowly ? ? END
did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ? END
did men become UNK as they grew older , UNK , UNK , reluctant to let go ? ? END
it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to UNK their lives , while others could live UNK motionless almost indefinitely , like UNK in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . END
perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it . END
and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , UNK , UNK , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them . END
there was no compulsion behind them . END
they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn . END
during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . END
this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . END
he looked at the luminous UNK of his wrist watch . END
it was five minutes after four . END
on some distant farm a UNK UNK and , far down the valley , an associate answered . END
he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . END
at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . END
thus committed , action might follow . END
he went down to mills and UNK hardware store and bought a full set of UNK tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr. mills said were essential for UNK and UNK , whatever they were . END
he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , UNK and glue and UNK nails , levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . END
`` there '' , said mr. mills . END
`` that'll get you started . END
best not to get everything at once . END
add things as you find you need 'em '' . END
he didn't even ask the cost of this collection . END
after all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . END
when he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , UNK had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . END
it gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . END
he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . END
he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . END
that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . END
in front of it would be his workbench . END
the old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't UNK it with a sleeping pill and send it away . END
how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ? END
how did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ? END
after the pegboard there would be the paneling . END
he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . END
perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . END
but then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ? END
it all seemed rather hopeless . END
he turned his attention to the workbench . END
perhaps that was the first thing to do . END
a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't UNK like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? END
mr. mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and UNK which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . END
they lay on the cellar floor in a UNK pile . END
mr. crombie poked at it UNK with his foot . END
how could anyone know what to do with an UNK like that ? ? END
perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . END
then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . END
after that everything should be simpler . END
he went upstairs to phone UNK . END
to his amazement he reached him . END
mr. UNK was laid up with a bad cold . END
he didn't seem to think that UNK a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the UNK equally lightly . END
the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . END
that was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch . END
no , he didn't know of any UNK . END
there wasn't any such thing any more . END
UNK all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . END
there was a fellow named blatz over UNK way . END
nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . END
mr. UNK would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night . END
if he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with mr. crombie . END
mr. blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest UNK that had come into mr. UNK life since he moved to UNK , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless mr. crombie hung around and talked to him . END
he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you . END
so mr. crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr. UNK mind from funny things . END
at the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached UNK to stone walls , but mr. blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance . END
while mr. blatz was putting up the UNK and starting the workbench , mr. crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . END
mr. blatz agreed that this would be pretty . END
without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste . END
`` now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; ; END
then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about through down here '' . END
it all did look very efficient and UNK . END
there was no question of that . END
`` by the way '' , said mr. blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage . END
i guess you know about that . END
before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . END
that ain't too bad UNK the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' . END
instead of being depressed by this news , mr. crombie was actually relieved . END
at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools . END
he followed mr. blatz up the cellar stairs . END
as usual , mrs. crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking UNK . END
mr. blatz sat down in the only UNK kitchen chair . END
`` well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . END
he UNK be able to build a new house with all them UNK '' . END
mr. crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . END
`` i was just sayin' to him that i'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . END
mr. crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing . END
`` oh , that's wonderful '' , cried mrs. crombie . END
`` i have a thousand things for you to do . END
doors that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' END
`` but those are the things i built the workshop for '' , protested mr. crombie . END
`` those are the things i can do , now that i'm set up '' . END
`` i've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . END
`` we won't live long enough if i wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- UNK be plenty more '' . END
but the discussion was academic . END
mr. blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . END
nothing in english has been UNK as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . END
ben franklin said , `` clearly spoken , mr. fogg . END
you explain english by greek '' . END
richard UNK UNK said , `` i think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . END
and a witty american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' . END
there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by UNK under such names as UNK , UNK , and other UNK . END
in common UNK they would be described as misses -- UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK misdeeds . END
one species of ambiguity tries to UNK by UNK repetition . END
`` did you or did you not say what i said you said , because jane said you never said what i said '' ? ? END
another woman , addressing christmas cards , said to her husband : `` we sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ? END
such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the UNK UNK . END
ambiguity of a UNK kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . END
`` i'm terribly upset '' , she told a UNK . END
`` i wrote bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . END
evidently bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women . END
another case involves a newspaper reporter who UNK up a politician . END
`` mr. jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having UNK the contradiction of your original statement . END
now would you care to have us say that you were UNK in regard to it '' ? ? END
questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever UNK an experienced politician . END
they recall byron's classic comment : `` i wish he would explain his explanation '' . END
similarly , when a reporter once questioned lincoln in UNK fashion , lincoln refused to make any further statement . END
`` i fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the UNK bit -- and bitter . END
the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks . END
`` senator '' , said an UNK , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . END
`` good '' ! ! END
`` it took me five hours to write it that way '' . END
the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . END
this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . END
a verse familiar to all UNK is the UNK : `` i saw a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree . END
now can you tell me who was drunk -- the man , his wife , or me '' ? ? END
the `` UNK '' gag of vaudeville , another UNK of this sort , had endless variations . END
`` there's a man outside with a wooden leg named smith '' . END
`` what's the name of his other leg '' ? ? END
another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . END
when radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its UNK as a standard device . END
`` do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ? END
`` i see the girl but i don't see the car with slacks on '' . END
in recent years UNK have discovered this brand of UNK and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the UNK . END
in one UNK a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's UNK and my wife's behind '' . END
journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . END
not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` UNK must be of a person not larger than af inches '' . END
classified ads are also UNK of UNK constructions . END
readers of the reader's UNK are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a california paper that advertised `` house for rent . END
view takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' . END
since UNK is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . END
`` officials meet on rubbish . END
many shapes in UNK . END
son and daughter of local couple married '' . END
apart from misplaced UNK and UNK , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter . END
a weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their UNK '' . END
an item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` i personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' . END
then there was the UNK ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ? END
we have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . END
the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . END
this slip is so-called because its UNK english always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . END
samples : he walked in upon her invitation . END
she kissed him UNK upon his UNK . END
he kissed her back . END
not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular UNK . END
in news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . END
`` while henry morgan was UNK miss UNK green from the church social last saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit mr. morgan on the public square '' . END
such items recall the california journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` the area in which miss n -- was injured is UNK scenic '' . END
the double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the UNK of UNK and fields . END
when a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing UNK , he replied , `` no , it was in the stomach '' . END
strangely enough , this always brought the house down . END
apart from UNK and vaudeville UNK , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . END
a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . END
her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case . END
it read : `` shot in the UNK region '' . END
after a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she UNK into the record : `` shot in the woods '' . END
there are many grammatical UNK other than dangling UNK and UNK which permit two different interpretations . END
at the home of a UNK the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . END
`` i want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the UNK explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . END
`` that's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said . END
but since the UNK insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed . END
so she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth . END
another specimen of such UNK is illustrated by a woman in a department store . END
she said to the UNK , `` i want a dress to put on around the house '' . END
the puzzled UNK inquired , `` how large is your house , UNK '' ? ? END
this UNK was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department . END
when a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` what size is your alligator '' ? ? END
the comic indefinite UNK an extensive class of comedy . END
one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . END
a woman met a famous author at a literary tea . END
`` oh , i'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed . END
`` it was only the other day that i saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . END
this baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence . END
`` i may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , i may not '' . END
the girl nodded UNK . END
`` yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ? END
an old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter , `` you must have gotten in quite late last night , dear . END
where were you '' ? ? END
the daughter replied , `` oh , i had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- i don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a cute little night club -- i forget the name of it . END
why , it's all right , isn't it , mother '' ? ? END
her UNK parent agreed . END
`` of course , dear '' , she said . END
`` it's only that i like to know where you go '' . END
no less ambiguous was the UNK of a certain UNK sermon . END
`` dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you UNK of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , i regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' . END
this clergyman should have referred to shakespeare's dictum : `` so-so is a good , very good , very excellent UNK . END
and yet it is not . END
it is but so-so '' . END
indefinite reference also carries UNK where an UNK to one person or thing seems to refer to another . END
a news item described the UNK of a ship : `` completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . END
this is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool : `` four trucks to fort mason UNK , 7:30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance . END
the bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' . END
a politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . END
`` what are my chances for taking joe's place '' ? ? END
`` if you can fix it up with the UNK '' , returned the politician , `` it's all right with me '' . END
the manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite . END
`` what have you got on today '' ? ? END
`` a blue suit '' , he answered . END
`` who's in it '' ? ? END
`` i am '' , he said . END
there was a short pause for reflection . END
`` oh '' , said the woman , `` i've seen that picture already '' . END
another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb . END
when a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . END
the UNK night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her UNK for some time . END
finally he asked , `` do you object to UNK '' ? ? END
`` that's one thing i've never done '' , she said promptly . END
he thought a moment , then inquired , `` you mean UNK '' ? ? END
`` no '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . END
replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive UNK . END
it would be hard to find anything more UNK than : `` i cannot recommend him too highly '' . END
another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` the bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . END
if you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . END
in the comedy of indefinite reference , UNK occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . END
ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . END
two friends were talking . END
one said , `` when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' . END
the speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . END
UNK is a UNK because it covers slips as well as wit . END
an excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` doctor , please come over right away . END
my husband is in great pain . END
i called the other afternoon on my old friend , graves moreland , the UNK literary critic -- his mother was born in ohio -- who lives alone in a UNK cottage on the UNK downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor . END
my UNK friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , UNK , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . END
after UNK became the greatest man in the world , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in UNK , moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . END
a UNK place is in the UNK '' . END
`` i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , i told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . END
`` i seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . END
did you go to their funeral '' ? ? END
`` i was wrong '' , i admitted . END
`` comedy didn't die , it just went crazy . END
it has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . END
we now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as horror UNK , and sick UNK . END
there are even publications called sick and mad . END
the UNK is not crazy as a UNK or mad as a march UNK ; ; END
it is UNK as a man '' . END
`` i woke up this morning '' , moreland said , `` UNK lewis carroll . END
do you want to hear the UNK '' ? ? END
`` can i bear it '' ? ? END
i asked , taking a final UNK of my drink , and handing him the empty glass . END
`` just barely '' , he said , and repeated his UNK : `` the time has come '' , the UNK said , `` to speak of UNK things , of shots and shouts , and sealing UNK of UNK and kings '' . END
moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` for god's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . END
`` i'll try '' , i said , and sat for a moment thinking . END
`` oh yes , the other day i reread some of UNK english traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany , more than a hundred years ago . END
in the railway station at berlin , a uniformed attendant was UNK , ' foreigners this way ! ! END
foreigners this way ' ! ! END
one woman -- she could have been either english or american -- went up to him and said , ' but you are the foreigners ' '' . END
i took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` i admit that going back to ralph UNK emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' . END
`` what's the matter with the music '' ? ? END
`` it doesn't UNK out the dialogue '' , i explained . END
`` let's talk about books '' , moreland said . END
`` i am told that in america you have UNK by UNK , brought out by UNK for UNK . END
is it all UNK '' ? ? END
`` there is UNK and non UNK '' , i said . END
`` speaking of UNK : the other day , in a story about a UNK demonstration , the paris herald tribune wrote , ' the UNK became UNK . END
and then eichmann was quoted as saying , in UNK , that hitler's plan to UNK the jews was nonsense '' . END
`` if we cannot tell evil , horror , and UNK from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? ? END
moreland asked , grimly . END
`` UNK '' , i said . END
`` they require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ? END
in our present era of science and UNK , the heart has been UNK , to use one of our popular UNK verbs '' . END
`` i know what you mean '' , moreland sighed . END
`` last year your tennessee williams told our UNK powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the UNK to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart . END
like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the UNK glands , and the UNK central nervous system . END
i'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it UNK a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with UNK fills and dances with the UNK . END
the sentimental pure heart of UNK is gone with the UNK years , but i still believe in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks '' . END
`` we no longer have tom UNK and UNK ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , i said . END
`` moore and UNK didn't have the fate that faces us '' , moreland said . END
`` one day our species promises UNK , and the next day it threatens UNK '' . END
we sat for a while drinking in silence . END
`` the heart '' , i said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes . END
when it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was '' . END
there was a long silence . END
`` you have visited england five times in the past UNK , i believe '' , my host said . END
`` what has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? ? END
`` i would say depressed , not impressed '' , i told him . END
`` i should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable UNK for sex dramas , involving clergymen and UNK , psychiatrists and patients . END
it is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political UNK from the modern theatre '' . END
`` do you think we need a new henry james to UNK the UNK scene '' ? ? END
`` or perhaps a new noel coward '' ? ? END
`` but you must have heard it said that the UNK disappeared forever with the UNK years of james and the UNK UNK of coward . END
i myself hear it said constantly -- in UNK . END
in them , there is usually a group of UNK with UNK problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . END
i stood up and began pacing . END
`` if you are trying to get us out of the UNK , the UNK , the kitchen sink , and the UNK UNK , you are probably wasting your time '' , moreland told me . END
`` too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . END
`` UNK and UNK '' , i said . END
`` i am worried about the current meanings of the word funny . END
it now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ; END
disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; END
and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights '' . END
moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which i made each of us a new drink . END
he took his glass , UNK it against mine , and said , `` UNK UNK , what the hell '' ! ! END
borrowing a line from don UNK UNK . END
`` be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . END
it now means , in my country , UNK '' , i said . END
`` oh , i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . END
recently , by the way , i received a questionnaire in which i was asked whether or not i was UNK '' . END
my host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; END
then he turned to me . END
`` is it true that you believe the other animals are UNK than the human species '' ? ? END
`` oh , that is UNK '' , i told him . END
`` do you remember the woman in the french UNK who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened UNK ? ? END
she told the sheep , ' the world is coming to an end ' ! ! END
and the sheep said -- all in UNK , i have no doubt -- UNK ! ! END
the sound UNK of sheep is like the UNK horse laugh '' . END
`` that is only partly UNK '' , he began . END
`` if you saw the drama called UNK '' , i said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of UNK when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a UNK . END
the UNK would panic , screaming help ! ! END
-- if that can be screamed in their language '' . END
`` you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ? END
`` UNK , no '' , i said . END
`` the political and intellectual left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy . END
nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , khrushchev , the UNK UNK , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . END
in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as ed UNK . END
but , like caesar , he has only one joke , so far as i can find out . END
it consists in saying , ' that would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage . END
why in the name of his UNK doesn't he vary it a bit '' ? ? END
`` such as '' ? ? END
`` such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' '' . END
`` you and i have fallen out of literature into politics '' , moreland observed . END
`` what a nasty fall was there '' ! ! END
moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , UNK . END
`` the world that was once UNK and UNK '' , he said , `` has now become UNK and UNK . END
in our age of science and UNK it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space '' . END
`` the human ego being what it is '' , i put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic UNK fruit bats . END
it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . END
`` now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , moreland protested . END
`` not in the largest sense of the words '' , i said . END
`` the other day arnold toynbee spoke against the UNK tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its UNK , and its virtually everything else . END
why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it UNK in something else ? ? END
forty years ago an english writer , w. l. george , dealt with this subject in UNK of the day , and said , as an example , that ' saint george for merry england ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' strike UNK UNK dead ' '' ! ! END
`` there was also UNK UNK UNK '' , moreland reminded me , `` and UNK UNK UNK , or if you will , UNK UNK UNK . END
it isn't what the UNK believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . END
this is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the UNK and the UNK to become head of a state . END
complete power not only UNK but it also UNK the mad . END
there is a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . END
`` great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , i said . END
`` but we now find writers obsessed by the UNK and UNK of their ivory towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and UNK . END
i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about . END
one day , the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's horse . END
they wanted to see what his back felt like -- the general's . END
he looked so comfortable being straight . END
they wanted to touch the mystery . END
arlene was UNK them up when the policeman came by . END
he was very rude . END
arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . END
the UNK eyes rather popped for a second ; ; END
but then arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` if it wasn't for these dear children '' -- . END
the policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` now , look here , lady : i know you got to entertain these kids and all . END
but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . END
arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` yes , sir '' . END
the policeman walked on , but he looked back once . END
that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . END
arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; END
and they had told their mother about the UNK . END
in matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; END
and so they were consistently true to their principles . END
`` never mind '' , arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual UNK course of UNK . END
i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . END
`` what is it '' ? ? END
asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . END
maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the UNK of arlene . END
`` just you wait '' , advised arlene , UNK the dialogue in a recent british movie . END
and when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most UNK magnificent time . END
first , arlene had put them through some rapid UNK . END
they had protested that that wasn't any surprise . END
`` just you wait '' , said arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling UNK of that handy little sturdy statement . END
`` this is a UNK '' . END
`` is it anything like UNK UNK '' ? ? END
asked one of the children . END
`` not the least bit '' , arlene snapped . END
one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . END
those were especially the ones that all other UNK laughed at loudest . END
she would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously . END
but not hard for very long . END
just long enough to make you feel important . END
`` now '' , said arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable . END
`` now , we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make us think of '' . END
the children looked at each other and UNK their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . END
their curiosity went happily out of bounds . END
then , arlene threw herself UNK and UNK in a way that was just wonderful . END
she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . END
`` imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said . END
they both laughed and winked back . END
`` i'm general burnside's horse , upside down '' , arlene said , sort of UNK , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position . END
she made general burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down . END
then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . END
and she would wink and throw kisses . END
they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . END
but they kept on clapping for a long , long time . END
`` this time '' , arlene said , and she even kept on UNK a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing . END
it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse '' . END
this time , it was so grand ; ; END
they could tell exactly what it was . END
it was general burnside's horse running in a circle . END
his legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders . END
`` that's the general's horse '' , one of them cried out . END
the other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` that's a funny old horse '' . END
the first one said , `` he sure does shake . END
then there was the general kissing his wife . END
they had to be told that one . END
but it was even UNK after they had been told . END
their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just UNK their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the UNK and put them in the electric UNK . END
but not general burnside . END
he was the UNK man . END
he never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet . END
then , they had to get up and be general burnside . END
all they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out . END
it wasn't very funny . END
then , they said general burnside was going to jump over his horse's head ; ; END
and they did some UNK . END
but that wasn't very funny , either . END
`` you ought to shake '' , arlene advised them . END
and arlene showed them how to begin . END
she also taught them to sing `` i wish i could UNK like my sister kate '' . END
that helped a lot . END
they were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on . END
they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling . END
`` imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , arlene suggested . END
that helped a great deal . END
they were a little late in getting home . END
`` i'm sorry , mrs. UNK '' , arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . END
my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us . END
`` it's perfectly understandable , arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way . END
`` i suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? ? END
`` yes , ma'am '' , the children UNK heartily . END
we couldn't help laughing . END
the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; ; END
and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open . END
`` UNK a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; END
but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded . END
that tap had a slight UNK quality . END
`` she really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . END
her upper lip lifted slightly . END
she was biting into a small red radish ; ; END
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . END
also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . END
she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . END
it never worked , naturally ; ; END
but it made her look unusual . END
also , when she had UNK off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; END
and she would snatch the UNK half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . END
one could hear a very faint , UNK sigh of relief . END
actually , it was UNK to anyone not expecting it . END
but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public . END
later on , the children told her further about UNK . END
`` it must be awfully good for them . END
and awfully kind of arlene '' , she told us later . END
`` but do you know something curious '' ? ? END
`` i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress . END
i have no notion why i reached . END
and i found a radish . END
was it an UNK ? ? END
i thought for a second . END
but i would not UNK myself in that silly way . END
i opened the window and threw the radish out '' . END
then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; END
for she knew and we knew that it was UNK that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . END
arlene became indispensable ; ; END
nobody could have told why . END
it was in the air . END
a friend of my father's came to dinner . END
he was passing through town and phoned to say hello . END
as a result , he was persuaded out to dinner . END
as a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months . END
sometimes , he coincided with my father's being at home . END
sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . END
but he was always persuaded out . END
he liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; END
the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . END
when he had left , i could never remember whether he had poked them in their UNK , UNK , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . END
the children loathed him , too . END
this evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them . END
there had been some coconut in it , for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a UNK bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver . END
they were pushed gently into the room by arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . END
we had just sat down . END
`` tell mr. gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , UNK . END
there was an air of revolt about the children -- even UNK for their own principles . END
this could be told chiefly from a sort of UNK and UNK , a UNK UNK of UNK . END
possibly , the UNK dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration . END
but , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air . END
`` we go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said . END
`` we have good times '' . END
this happy bulletin UNK mr. gorboduc . END
`` you do '' ? ? END
he asked , between UNK of laughter . END
he was forced to wipe his eyes . END
`` you don't step on the flowers , do you ? ? END
one of the children UNK out of range of the poking index finger . END
`` no '' , he said . END
`` we don't '' . END
mr. gorboduc took a UNK of his sherry . END
he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs . END
usually , this was done when attention was UNK by someone else's long , boring story . END
but this time she was nervous : she was open . END
mr. gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again . END
`` tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? ? END
this was delivered in a forthright way , without UNK and UNK interest -- an admirable way with children . END
only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging UNK of the direct command . END
this UNK the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of UNK and UNK accomplishment . END
`` we bump '' , one said ; ; END
and the other went on to development of the idea . END
`` we UNK , too '' , he said . END
my mother was beside herself with curiosity . END
`` say that again '' , she pleaded . END
she laughed a little and tossed the dregs UNK around in her glass . END
`` you what '' ? ? END
she could see that mr. gorboduc was UNK ; ; END
the hostess in her took over . END
she was UNK happy . END
`` you what '' ? ? END
my uncle looked at mr. gorboduc . END
he read henry james and used to pretend UNK through UNK at people . END
mr. gorboduc looked down . END
he would not look up . END
he was very funny about the whole thing . END
UNK UNK de UNK ad UNK UNK , a delightful UNK set in the UNK epoch of UNK war rome . END
UNK , the hero , is beset from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood . END
the story opens on the eve of his UNK birthday , as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow . END
suddenly , a messenger arrives and , just before UNK dead at his feet , informs him that the UNK have invaded UNK , the home province of his UNK . END
he at once UNK the UNK and , UNK on his UNK , UNK blindly from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing UNK . END
the albany civic UNK presentation of UNK immortal UNK UNK del UNK , with guest UNK UNK UNK . END
an unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of UNK from the rock by the u.s. cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather UNK company amid cheers of `` UNK UNK '' and `` UNK pip pip '' ! ! END
after a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene -- the UNK valley in northern maine . END
a dead UNK , the sole occupant of the stage , UNK the crisis and destruction of the old order . END
old order , acted and UNK sung by UNK UNK , the lovely UNK import , then entered and delivered the well-known UNK to the god UNK , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering UNK priests , UNK love , lust , prudence and general motors , respectively . END
according to the myth , old order then UNK at stage left and UNK at extreme stage right , but director UNK skillfully UNK the rather UNK problem of stage effects by simply having miss UNK walk across the stage . END
the night he saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the UNK , complaining -- in UNK -- that `` it smelled '' . END
we caught the early train to new york . END
the UNK dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with UNK UNK cults . END
it's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . END
for example , probably very few people know that the word `` UNK '' that is UNK about so much today stems from the verb `` UNK '' : to UNK . END
likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely UNK as `` UNK '' , `` UNK '' , and the UNK `` UNK '' all originated in the same village in UNK province and are all used to express sentiments concerning british `` UNK '' . END
the terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start UNK them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of major UNK delhi regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit . END
the breeze and chancellor neitzbohr , a movie UNK that concerns the attempts of a west german politician to UNK a plaster cast of the apollo UNK . END
as you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with UNK , UNK , and UNK theory . END
for example , when the film is only four minutes old , neitzbohr refers to a small , victorian piano stool as `` UNK '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a UNK that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an UNK UNK whose name , of course , was doris ( the english equivalent , when passed through UNK UNK , of UNK ) . END
for the remainder of the movie , chancellor neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a UNK from a venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war UNK . END
in this manner , he seeks to UNK from his own soul the guilt UNK caused by his personal assaults against the english at UNK . END
as we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( UNK doris , therefore the english ) that he is UNK but the piece of venetian blind . END
and , when the UNK finally UNK , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` he loves me , he loves me not '' . END
after a few UNK moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera UNK across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that neitzbohr is trying to UNK himself in the eyes of a UNK piece of sculpture . END
the effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a UNK catharsis for the `` UNK '' UNK . END
the music of UNK UNK , capital UNK UNK , one of the rare recordings of this UNK , yet UNK , composer . END
those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the UNK festival in august , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; END
and it is not unlikely that , even as the great bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the UNK , ingenious UNK passed through his `` UNK '' of neglect . END
but now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer UNK UNK , jr. , a major revival is under way . END
as he leads the UNK UNK orchestra , UNK gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the UNK and UNK concertos , including the controversial UNK UNK , which was included at the UNK insistence . END
a major portion of the credit should also go to UNK UNK for his rendering of the almost impossible `` indianapolis '' movement in the UNK . END
not only was UNK intonation and phrasing without UNK , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride . END
for example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest UNK register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the UNK UNK , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the UNK credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . END
we would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . END
as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by UNK , UNK , commercially successful UNK and UNK problem dramas , the american theatre is going through an UNK renaissance in that UNK area known as `` UNK '' . END
for the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` UNK '' which have left indelible , UNK impressions on the psyche of this veteran UNK . END
the latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the , an adaptation of UNK classic UNK by roger UNK , a former university of maryland chemistry instructor . END
although the play does show a certain structural UNK ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the UNK yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . END
the action centers about a group of outspoken and UNK students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . END
they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a UNK , the police , and an UNK government tutor . END
the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of UNK pie , gets a plate of english UNK instead . END
leaving the theatre after the performance , i had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as UNK said ) , is just a search for the UNK cup of hot coffee , and that this UNK , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks UNK retired . END
aging but still UNK , french UNK UNK terrible UNK lagoon has succeeded in shocking UNK old paris again , this time with a UNK ballet UNK called the UNK interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac UNK operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel . END
a biting , UNK UNK of the UNK UNK of modern life , the piece has been set by UNK lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand french horns ) by UNK UNK UNK UNK . END
UNK , lovely UNK UNK plays the nymphomaniac UNK . END
ever since UNK , and , more recently , born free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with max UNK wry , UNK , charming , and immensely UNK my friend , the UNK UNK . END
done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , fink tells in UNK detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's pet UNK , alicia . END
it is not an entirely happy book , as mrs. fink soon becomes jealous of alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to UNK the algae off her glass . END
max , in a fit of despair , takes alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in UNK ( fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which alicia UNK contracts UNK disease and dies . END
this brief resume hardly does the book justice , but i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time . END
opera in the grand tradition , along with UNK , seems to be UNK a UNK UNK . END
in this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , felix UNK and anna UNK . END
UNK , a lean , UNK , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for sir UNK UNK , is responsible for the UNK of UNK earliest , most raucous opera , UNK , a sumptuous UNK with a haunting UNK that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the UNK version of `` UNK '' . END
miss UNK has a voice that maria UNK once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , UNK face becomes UNK reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of UNK . END
the UNK UNK is literally littered this summer with the UNK bodies of france's UNK beatnik UNK UNK . END
cause of all this commotion : squat , UNK , UNK , hopelessly ugly UNK bravado , a UNK figure , who plays a UNK , UNK , philosophic UNK salesman in old UNK UNK de UNK UNK endlessly provocative film , a UNK sponge . END
bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of france and myself '' ( de gaulle ) and `` a UNK , disgusting slob '' ! ! END
( norman UNK ) , but no one can deny that the screen UNK with electricity whenever he is on it . END
soaring to UNK along with him , UNK felicity UNK , a UNK and UNK UNK italian UNK , turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . END
the battle of the UNK continues , but most of new york's knowing UNK of abstract UNK are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of v ( for vindication ) day , september first , when augustus UNK first one-man show opens at the UNK . END
we have heard that after seeing mr. UNK work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . END
and it is thought by many who think about such things that UNK is the logical culmination of a school that started with UNK , progressed through UNK and the cubist picasso , and UNK just recently in pollock and de UNK . END
UNK defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . END
`` i paint the nothing '' , he said once to UNK UNK and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the UNK , UNK ' UNK ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in UNK '' . END
it is his UNK and UNK adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` the invasion of cuba '' . END
in this work , his use of UNK is startling and skillful . END
the sweep of space , the delicate UNK of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . END
i asked UNK recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical UNK way of UNK me for my lack of sensitivity . END
dear UNK : let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . END
the collective by which i address you in the title above is neither UNK nor UNK but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves . END
it is , i am UNK given to understand , the technical UNK for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; ; END
i.e. , UNK who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to UNK UNK , those who work while the occupants are home . END
since the latter obviously require an UNK you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that i am UNK you as socially inferior . END
far from it ; ; END
i merely draw an UNK distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a UNK . END
above all , UNK yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your UNK my residence , to UNK over the loss of a few UNK UNK , or to shame you into UNK . END
my object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . END
you have unwittingly set in motion forces so UNK , so UNK , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . END
quite UNK , fellows , i wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in china . END
as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent UNK , permit me to UNK them briefly . END
sometime on saturday evening , august UNK , while my family and i were dining at the UNK UNK UNK , in rome , you UNK a window of our home in bucks county , pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . END
UNK to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool UNK , some UNK pants , and the like , and to UNK the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . END
what you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis UNK and fly screens ) UNK me , but to judge from UNK records scattered about a UNK UNK . END
you danced two UNK and a paso UNK , which must have been fairly UNK in that milieu . END
you then descended one story , UNK a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom . END
from the UNK cabinet on its south wall and the UNK beneath , you UNK seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin , two UNK , and a UNK UNK glass . END
UNK through a stack of drawers nearby , you UNK an antique french UNK set in ivory and UNK , which , along with two box UNK , you added to your haul . END
then , having wrapped the lot in an UNK my dog customarily slept on , you UNK out the front door , UNK leaving it open for neighbors to discover . END
so much for the UNK facts , as familiar to you , i'm sure , as to the UNK and state troopers who followed in your wake . END
the foregoing , aided by several clues i'll UNK to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector UNK , but before they close in , UNK yourselves , i repeat , for a vengeance UNK more UNK . END
fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to UNK and your hair falls out in patches . END
in time , these minor manifestations will multiply and UNK , UNK you with UNK , the king's evil , sheep rot , and UNK UNK , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release . END
all this , though , is simply a prelude , a UNK , for what UNK , and i doubt whether any UNK could accurately forecast it . END
if , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , i can UNK the powers of a few of the UNK you've UNK and describe the punishment they UNK out in one analogous instance . END
first of all , the six figures of the buddha you UNK -- four siamese heads , a black UNK UNK in the UNK position , and a large brass figure of the dying buddha on a UNK base . END
now , you probably share the widespread western belief that the lord buddha is the most UNK of the gods , much more so than UNK and UNK and the rest . END
UNK up -- don't you ? ? END
well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the wheel of the law specifies ) toward UNK folk who steal , disturb , or UNK the presence . END
very peculiar retribution indeed seems to UNK such UNK . END
eight or ten years ago , a couple of french UNK stole a priceless UNK head from the UNK UNK , in paris , and a week later crawled into the UNK with unmistakable symptoms of UNK . END
UNK own amount of UNK oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; END
they expired amid indescribable UNK , UNK the blessed one to forgive their UNK . END
any reputable french UNK can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and i'll presently UNK a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our catalogue . END
whether the pair of UNK ivory UNK you lifted really possess the UNK to turn your UNK to lead , as a dealer in UNK assured me , i am not competent to say . END
likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( UNK UNK ) ; ; END
a friend of mine removing her from the UNK cabinet for inspection was UNK as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of UNK . END
the three indian brass UNK , though -- UNK , UNK , and UNK -- are an altogether different cup of tea . END
they hail from UNK , a state in the UNK where UNK , the UNK of death , is UNK . END
have you ever heard of UNK ? ? END
but it is the wooden sculpture from UNK , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that i particularly call to your attention . END
oddly enough , this is an UNK against UNK , presented to the UNK and me by a local UNK in 1949 . END
inscribed around its base is a charm in UNK , a dialect i take it you don't comprehend . END
neither do i , but the UNK UNK was good enough to translate , and i'll do as much for you . END
UNK UNK our UNK , the legend states , can expect UNK sorrow . END
the teeth will rain from his mouth like UNK , his wife will make him UNK with UNK , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach . END
furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the UNK UNK to throw away or dispose of their UNK . END
the cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the UNK generation . END
sort of UNK , isn't it ? ? END
still , there it is . END
now , you no doubt regard the preceding as UNK ; ; END
you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , UNK yourselves on UNK and playing UNK in the taverns and generally behaving like UNK . END
in that case , listen to what UNK another UNK who tangled with our UNK . END
a couple of years back , i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of UNK called a `` coffin turn '' . END
in it was a stone UNK buddha i had picked up in UNK , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and i UNK it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap . END
after a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we UNK it . END
our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a UNK boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered UNK to the people overhead . END
the more i UNK into this young man's activities and character , the less savory i found him . END
i learned , for example , that he made a practice of UNK at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to UNK their feet . END
his energy was prodigious ; ; END
sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into UNK to UNK us , and thereafter would hurry to the bronx zoo to UNK at the lions and press cigar butts against their UNK . END
evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like UNK & UNK or peter's UNK drunkenly UNK ladies' hats and singing `` o sole UNK '' . END
in short , and to borrow an UNK phrase , UNK timber . END
well , the UNK little toad went along UNK animals and humans who couldn't UNK , and in due course , as was inevitable , UNK himself . END
one morning , we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been UNK out in its lap . END
`` now he's bought it '' , said my wife UNK . END
`` no divinity will hold still for that . END
he's really asking for it '' . END
and how right she was . END
the next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ; END
he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of UNK , was UNK with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . END
some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a UNK voice -- either an UNK UNK or UNK UNK , a UNK , we couldn't determine which . END
his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr. UNK UNK when he was found before his open safe wearing the UNK band . END
the grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of UNK , and let him go . END
the beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the UNK way the buddha polished him off . END
reduced to UNK , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer . END
his UNK , deficiency of taste , and UNK carried him UNK to the top . END
he evolved programs that UNK new depths of UNK and UNK whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . END
not long ago , i rode down with him in an elevator in radio city ; ; END
he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two UNK at once , clearly a man in UNK . END
`` see that guy '' ? ? END
the operator asked UNK . END
`` i wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china . END
there's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . END
however one looks at it , therefore , i'd say that your UNK for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . END
the inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move ; ; END
you can't very well UNK up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot UNK . END
additionally , since you're going to be UNK de combat pretty soon with UNK , UNK , delhi boil , the UNK UNK , liver UNK , UNK , and a host of other complications of the UNK you've aroused , you mustn't expect to be UNK socially . END
my advice , if you live long enough to continue your UNK , is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic , pass it up -- it's nothing but a headache . END
as you can count on me to do the same . END
the doors of the d train slid shut , and as i dropped into a seat and , UNK , looked up across the aisle , the whole UNK in my head burst into song . END
she was a living doll and no mistake -- the UNK bang , the wide cheekbones , UNK , that betrayed the UNK strain in her midwestern UNK , and the mouth whose only fault , in the UNK UNK phrase , was that the lower lip was a trifle too UNK . END
from what i was able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the figure inside the UNK UNK dress was UNK . END
